The structure and function of the BBB is summarised, the physical barrier formed by the endothelial tight junctions, and the transport barrier resulting from membrane transporters and vesicular mechanisms. The roles of associated cells are outlined, especially the endfeet of astrocytic glial cells, and pericytes and microglia. The embryonic development of the BBB, and changes in pathology are described. The BBB is subject to short and long-term regulation, which may be disturbed in pathology. Any programme for drug discovery or delivery, to target or avoid the CNS, needs to consider the special features of the BBB.",

However, they can be activated by free radicals and free fatty acids, and their activity has a profound influence on neuronal function. By regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, calcium flux, free radical production and local temperature, neuronal UCPs can directly influence neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity and neurodegenerative processes.

Starting from the microscopic properties of GLUT carriers, and within the constraints imposed by the available experimental data, chiefly NMR spectroscopy, we have generated a numerical model that reveals several hidden features of glucose transport and metabolism in the brain. The half-saturation constant of glucose uptake into the brain (K(t)) is close to 8 mM. GLUT carriers at the BBB are symmetric, show accelerated-exchange, and a K(m) of zero-trans flux (K(zt)) close to 5 mM, determining a ratio of 3.6 between maximum transport rate and net glucose flux (T(max)/CMR(glc)). In spite of the low transporter occupancy, the model shows that for a stimulated hexokinase to pull more glucose into the brain, the number or activity of GLUT carriers must also increase, particularly at the BBB. The endothelium is therefore predicted to be a key modulated element for the fast control of energy metabolism. In addition, the simulations help to explain why mild hypoglycemia may be asymptomatic and reveal that [glucose](brain) (as measured by NMR) should be much more sensitive than glucose flux (as measured by PET) as an indicator of GLUT1 deficiency. In summary, available data from various sources has been integrated in a predictive model based on the microscopic properties of GLUT carriers.",

On the other hand, high [K+]-stimulated aerobic glycolysis that accompanies the acetylcholine-sensitive enhanced glial uptakes of Na+ and water is unaffected by acetylcholine (2 mM). Experiments done under a variety of metabolic conditions show that there exists a better correlation between diminished ATP content of the tissue and enhanced aerobic glycolysis than between tissue ATP and the ATP-dependent synthesis of glutamine. Whereas malonate (2 mM) and amino oxyacetate (5 mM) suppress ATP content and O2 uptake, stimulate lactate formation, but have little effect on glutamine levels, fluoroacetate (3 mM) suppresses glutamine synthesis in glia, presumably by suppressing the operation of the citric acid cycle, with little effect on ATP content, O2 uptake, and lactate formation. Exogenous citrate (5 mM), which may be transported and metabolized in glia but not in neurons, inhibits lactate formation by cell free acetone-dried powder extracts of brain cortex but not by brain cortex slices. These results suggest that the neuron is the major site of stimulated aerobic glycolysis in the brain, and that under our experimental conditions glycolysis in glia is under lesser stringent metabolic control than that in the neuron. Stimulation of aerobic glycolysis by protoveratrine occurs due to diminution of the energy charge of the neuron as a result of stimulation of the sodium pump following tetrodotoxin-sensitive influx of Na+; stimulation by high [K+], NH4+, or Ca2+ deprivation occurs partly by direct stimulation of key enzymes of glycolysis and partly by a fall in the tissue ATP concentration.",

Glucose metabolism in neurons is directed mainly to the pentose phosphate pathway, leading to regeneration of reduced glutathione.

    "abstxt": "In this review, we discuss a novel function of ascorbic acid in brain energetics. It has been proposed that during glutamatergic synaptic activity neurons preferably consume lactate released from glia. The key to this energetic coupling is the metabolic activation that occurs in astrocytes by glutamate and an increase in extracellular [K(+)]. Neurons are cells well equipped to consume glucose because they express glucose transporters and glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. Moreover, neuronal cells express monocarboxylate transporters and lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme 1, which is inhibited by pyruvate. As glycolysis produces an increase in pyruvate concentration and a decrease in NAD(+)/NADH, lactate and glucose consumption are not viable at the same time. In this context, we discuss ascorbic acid participation as a metabolic switch modulating neuronal metabolism between rest and activation periods. Ascorbic acid is highly concentrated in CNS. Glutamate stimulates ascorbic acid release from astrocytes. Ascorbic acid entry into neurons and within the cell can inhibit glucose consumption and stimulate lactate transport. For this switch to occur, an ascorbic acid flow is necessary between astrocytes and neurons, which is driven by neural activity and is part of vitamin C recycling. Here, we review the role of glucose and lactate as metabolic substrates and the modulation of neuronal metabolism by ascorbic acid.",

    "abstxt": "Hypoxia markedly depresses synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices of the rat. This depression is attributed to presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release and is largely mediated by adenosine released during hypoxia acting through presynaptic adenosine A(1) receptors. Paired pulse facilitation studies allowed us to confirm the presynaptic nature of the depression of synaptic transmission during hypoxia. We tested the hypothesis that activation of heterosynaptic inhibitory receptors localized in glutamatergic presynaptic terminals in the hippocampus, namely gamma-aminobutyric acid subtype B (GABA(B)) receptors, alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors, and muscarinic receptors might contribute to the hypoxia-induced depression of synaptic transmission. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in the CA1 area of hippocampal slices from young adult (5-6 weeks) Wistar rats. Neither the selective antagonist for alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors, rauwolscine (10 microM), nor the antagonist for the GABA(B) receptors, CGP 55845 (10 microM), modified the response to hypoxia. The selective adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist, DPCPX (50 nM), reduced the hypoxia-induced depression of synaptic transmission to 59.2+/-9.6%, and the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine (10 microM), in the presence of DPCPX (50 nM), further attenuated the depression of synaptic transmission to 49.4+/-8.0%. In the same experimental conditions, in the presence of DPCPX (50 nM), the muscarinic M(2) receptor antagonist AF-DX 116 (10 microM), but not the M(1) receptor antagonist pirenzepine (1 microM), also attenuated the hypoxia-induced depression to 41.6+/-6.6%. Activation of muscarinic M(2) receptors contributes to the depression of synaptic transmission upon hypoxia. This effect should assume particular relevance during prolonged periods of hypoxia when other mechanisms may become less efficient.",

Here we report the first quantitative evaluation of these opposing effects on tissue PO(2) in brain, using anesthetized rats exposed to HBO(2) at 2 to 6 atmospheres absolute (ATA). We assessed the contribution of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) to brain PO(2) as inspired PO(2) (PiO(2)) exceeds 1 ATA. We measured rCBF and local PO(2) simultaneously in striatum using collocated platinum electrodes. Cerebral blood flow was computed from H(2) clearance curves in vivo and PO(2) from electrodes calibrated in vitro, before and after insertion. Arterial PCO(2) was controlled, and body temperature, blood pressure, and EEG were monitored. Scatter plots of rCBF versus PO(2) were nonlinear (R(2)=0.75) for rats breathing room air but nearly linear (R(2)=0.88-0.91) for O(2) at 2 to 6 ATA. The contribution of rCBF to brain PO(2) was estimated at constant inspired PO(2), by increasing rCBF with acetazolamide (AZA) or decreasing it with N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). At basal rCBF (78 mL/100 g min), local PO(2) increased 7- to 33-fold at 2 to 6 ATA, compared with room air. A doubling of rCBF increased striatal PO(2) not quite two-fold in rats breathing room air but 13- to 64-fold in those breathing HBO(2) at 2 to 6 ATA. These findings support our hypothesis that HBO(2) increases PO(2) in brain in direct proportion to rCBF.",

Yet, the partial pressure and concentration of oxygen in the brain are low and non-uniform. There is a large number of enzymes that use O(2) as a substrate, the most important of which is cytochrome c oxidase, the key to mitochondrial ATP production. The affinity of cytochrome c oxidase for oxygen is very high, which under normal conditions ensures undiminished activity of oxidative phosphorylation down to very low P(O(2)). By contrast, many other relevant enzymes have K(m) values for oxygen within, or above, the ambient cerebral gas tension, thus making their operations very dependent on oxygen level in the physiological range. Among its multiple, versatile functions, oxygen partial pressure and concentration control production of reactive oxygen species, expression of genes and functions of ion channels. Limitation of oxygen supply to the brain below a 'critical' level reduces, and eventually blocks oxidative phosphorylation, drastically decreases cellular (ATP) and leads to a collapse of ion gradients. Neuronal activity ceases and if oxygen is not re-introduced quickly, cells die. The object of this review is to discuss briefly the central oxygen-dependent processes in mammalian brain and the short-term consequences of O(2) deprivation, but not the mechanisms of long-term adaptation to chronic hypoxia. Particular emphasis is placed on issues which have been the focus of recent attention and/or controversy.",

Although its actions in the individual cell are known in some detail, its effects at the network level are poorly understood. The hippocampus, which receives a major cholinergic input from the medial septum/diagonal band, is important in memory and exhibits network activity at 40 Hz during relevant behaviours. Here we show that cholinergic activation is sufficient to induce 40-Hz network oscillations in the hippocampus in vitro. Oscillatory activity is generated spontaneously in the CA3 subfield and can persist for hours. During the oscillatory state, principal neurons fire action potentials that are phase-related to the extracellular oscillation, but each neuron fires in only a small proportion of the cycles. Both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic events participate during the network oscillation in a precise temporal pattern. These results indicate that subcortical cholinergic input can control hippocampal memory processing by inducing fast network oscillations.",

This in part reflects the rapid effect of hypoxia on the neocortex, where oxygen deprivation leads to impaired neuronal excitability and abnormal synaptic transmission. To identify the cellular mechanisms responsible for the earliest changes in neocortical function and to determine their time course, we have used patch-in-slice recording techniques to investigate the effects of acute hypoxia on the synaptic and intrinsic properties of layer 5 neurons. Coronal slices of mouse somatosensory cortex were maintained at 37 degrees C and challenged with episodes of hypoxia (3-4 min of exposure to 95% N(2), 5% CO(2)). In recordings with cell-attached patch electrodes, activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels first became detectable 211 +/- 11 sec (range, 185-240 sec; n = 6 patches) after the onset of hypoxia. Similar recording techniques revealed no alterations in the properties of Na(+) currents in the first 4 min after the onset of hypoxia. The earliest hypoxia-induced disturbance was a marked increase in the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs, which began within 15-30 sec of the removal of oxygen. This rapid synaptic effect was not sensitive to TTX and was present in Ca(2+)-free perfusate, indicating that the hypoxia had a direct influence on the vesicular release mechanisms. The incoherent, massive increase in miniature PSCs would be expected to deplete the readily releasable pool of vesicles in cortical terminals, and to thereby markedly distort the neuronal interactions that underlie normal circuit function.",

This study examined the dynamic interaction between tissue oxygen tension (pO(2)) and NADH imaging changes within hippocampal tissue slices, during metabolic stresses including hypoxia and synaptic activation. The initiation of abrupt hypoxia (from 95% O(2) to 95% N(2)) caused a rapid decrease in pO(2), onset of hypoxic spreading depression (hsd; at 6.7+/-1.3 mm Hg; n=15), and a monophasic increase in NADH. Provided that reoxygenation was prompt, synaptic responses, pO(2) and NADH levels returned to baseline following hsd. Longer hypoxia caused irreversible neuronal dysfunction, an increase in pO(2) beyond baseline (due to decreased tissue demand), and hyperoxidation of NADH (10+/-2% decrease below baseline; n=7). Synaptic activation in ambient 95% O(2) caused a decrease or 'initial dip' in pO(2) and a biphasic NADH response (oxidation followed by reduction). The oxidizing phase of the NADH response was mitochondrial as it was synchronous with the 'initial' dip in pO(2). Following slow graded reductions in ambient oxygen levels to 8%, four of seven slices developed hsd following synaptic stimulation. The hypoxic threshold for graded oxygen reductions occurred at 7.9+/-5.8 mm Hg O(2) (n=7). Our hypoxic threshold range (6.7-7.9 mm Hg O(2) from abrupt and graded oxygen reduction, respectively) correlates well with reported in vivo values of &lt;12 mm Hg O(2). The major findings of this study include: 1) determination of the critical physiological threshold of pO(2) (based upon hsd), which is a marker of imminent neuronal death if oxygen is not rapidly restored; 2) NADH hyperoxidation and an increase in pO(2) beyond baseline levels following longer periods of hypoxia; and 3) the occurrence of a pO(2) 'dip' during synaptic stimulation, which correlates with the early oxidizing phase of the biphasic NADH response.",

For example, they are involved in the regulation of cytosolic Ca(2+) levels, intracellular pH and apoptosis, and are the major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Various reactive molecules that originate from mitochondria, such as ROS, are critical in pathological events, such as ischemia, as well as in physiological events such as long-term potentiation, neuronal-vascular coupling and neuronal-glial interactions. Due to their key roles in the regulation of several cellular functions, the dysfunction of mitochondria may be critical in various brain disorders. There has been increasing interest in the development of tools that modulate mitochondrial function, and the refinement of techniques that allow for real time monitoring of mitochondria, particularly within their intact cellular environment. Innovative imaging techniques are especially powerful since they allow for mitochondrial visualization at high resolution, tracking of mitochondrial structures and optical real time monitoring of parameters of mitochondrial function. The techniques discussed include classic imaging techniques, such as rhodamine-123, the highly advanced semi-conductor nanoparticles (quantum dots), and wide field microscopy as well as high-resolution multiphoton imaging. We have highlighted the use of these techniques to study mitochondrial function in brain tissue and have included studies from our laboratories in which these techniques have been successfully applied.",

These microelectrode biosensors record from the extracellular space in the vicinity of active synapses as they detect the synaptic field potentials evoked in area CA1 by stimulation of the afferent Schaffer collateral-commissural fibre pathway. Our new measurements demonstrate the rapid production of adenosine during hypoxia that precedes and accompanies depression of excitatory transmission within area CA1. Simultaneous measurement of adenosine release and synaptic transmission gives an estimated IC50 for adenosine on transmission in the low micromolar range. However, on reoxygenation, synaptic transmission recovers in the face of elevated extracellular adenosine and despite a post-hypoxic surge of adenosine release. This may indicate the occurrence of apparent adenosine A1 receptor desensitization during metabolic stress. In addition, adenosine release is unaffected by pharmacological blockade of glutamate receptors and shows depletion on repeated exposure to hypoxia. Our results thus suggest that adenosine release is not a consequence of excitotoxic glutamate release. The potential for adenosine A1 receptor desensitization during metabolic stress implies that its prevention may be beneficial in extending adenosine-mediated neuroprotection in a variety of clinically relevant conditions.",

The benefits of breathing HBO, however, are limited by the risk of central nervous system O2 toxicity, which presents as seizures. We tested the hypothesis that excitability increases in CA1 neurons of the rat hippocampal slice (400 microm) over a continuum of hyperoxia that spans normobaric and hyperbaric pressures. Amplitude changes of the orthodromic population spike were used to assess neuronal O2 sensitivity before, during, and following exposure to 0, 0.6, 0.95 (control), 2.84, and 4.54 atmospheres absolute (ATA) O2. Polarographic O2 electrodes were used to measure tissue slice PO2 (PtO2). In 0.95 ATA O2, core PtO2 at 200 microm deep was 115\u00b116 Torr (mean\u00b1SE). Increasing O2 to 2.84 and 4.54 ATA increased core PtO2 to 1,222\u00b177 and 2,037\u00b1157 Torr, respectively. HBO increased the orthodromic population spike amplitude and usually induced hyperexcitability (i.e., secondary population spikes) and, in addition, a long-lasting potentiation of the orthodromic population spike that we have termed &quot;oxygen-induced potentiation&quot; (OxIP). Exposure to 0.60 ATA O2 and hypoxia (0.00 ATA) decreased core PtO2 to 84\u00b16 and 20\u00b14 Torr, respectively, and abolished the orthodromic response. Reoxygenation from 0.0 or 0.6 ATA O2, however, usually produced a response similar to that of HBO: hyperexcitability and activation of OxIP. We conclude that CA1 neurons exhibit increased excitability and neural plasticity over a broad range of PtO2, which can be activated by a single, hyperoxic stimulus. We postulate that transient acute hyperoxia stimulus, whether caused by breathing HBO or reoxygenation following hypoxia (e.g., disordered breathing), is a powerful stimulant for orthodromic activity and neural plasticity in the CA1 hippocampus.",

Here, we investigated conditions for the emergence of network oscillations in submerged slices prepared from the hippocampus of rats and mice. We found that the local oxygen level is critical for generation and propagation of both spontaneously occurring sharp wave-ripple oscillations and cholinergically induced fast oscillations. We suggest three ways to improve the oxygen supply to slices under submerged conditions: (i) optimizing chamber design for laminar flow of superfusion fluid; (ii) increasing the flow rate of superfusion fluid; and (iii) superfusing both surfaces of the slice. These improvements to the recording conditions enable detailed studies of neurons under more realistic conditions of network activity, which are essential for a better understanding of neuronal network operation.",

    "abstxt": "While the ultimate dependence of brain function on its energy supply is evident, how basic neuronal parameters and network activity respond to energy metabolism deviations is unresolved. The resting membrane potential (E(m)) and reversal potential of GABA-induced anionic currents (E(GABA)) are among the most fundamental parameters controlling neuronal excitability. However, alterations of E(m) and E(GABA) under conditions of metabolic stress are not sufficiently documented, although it is well known that metabolic crisis may lead to neuronal hyper-excitability and aberrant neuronal network activities. In this work, we show that in slices, availability of energy substrates determines whether GABA signaling displays an inhibitory or excitatory mode, both in neonatal neocortex and hippocampus. We demonstrate that in the neonatal brain, E(m) and E(GABA) strongly depend on composition of the energy substrate pool. Complementing glucose with ketone bodies, pyruvate or lactate resulted in a significant hyperpolarization of both E(m) and E(GABA), and induced a radical shift in the mode of GABAergic synaptic transmission towards network inhibition. Generation of giant depolarizing potentials, currently regarded as the hallmark of spontaneous neonatal network activity in vitro, was strongly inhibited both in neocortex and hippocampus in the energy substrate enriched solution. Based on these results we suggest the composition of the artificial cerebrospinal fluid, which bears a closer resemblance to the in vivo energy substrate pool. Our results suggest that energy deficits induce unfavorable changes in E(m) and E(GABA), leading to neuronal hyperactivity that may initiate a cascade of pathological events.",

Using electrophysiology, oxygen sensor microelectrode, and imaging techniques, we investigated the interactions of neuronal activity, interstitial pO2, and mitochondrial redox state [NAD(P)H and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) fluorescence] in the CA3 subfield of organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. We find that gamma oscillations and spontaneous network activity decrease significantly at pO2 levels that do not affect neuronal population responses as elicited by moderate electrical stimuli. Moreover, pO2 and mitochondrial redox states are tightly coupled, and electrical stimuli reveal transient alterations of redox responses when pO2 decreases within the normoxic range. Finally, evoked redox responses are distinct in somatic and synaptic neuronal compartments and show different sensitivity to changes in pO2. We conclude that the threshold of interstitial pO2 for robust CA3 network activities and required mitochondrial function is clearly above the &quot;critical&quot; value, which causes spreading depression as a result of generalized energy failure. Our study highlights the importance of a functional understanding of mitochondria and their implications on activities of individual neurons and neuronal networks.",

However, both energy demand and mitochondrial performance underlying gamma oscillations are unknown. We investigated the fundamental relationship between acetylcholine-induced gamma oscillations, mitochondrial gene expression and oxidative metabolism in hippocampal slice preparations of mouse and rat by applying electrophysiology, in situ hybridization, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, oxygen sensor microelectrode (interstitial partial oxygen pressure) and imaging of mitochondrial redox state [nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) and flavin adenine dinucleotide fluorescence]. We show that (i) gamma oscillation power, oxygen consumption and expression of complex I (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) subunits are higher in hippocampal subfield CA3 than in CA1 and dentate gyrus; (ii) the amount of oxygen consumption of gamma oscillations reaches that of seizure-like events; (iii) gamma oscillations are exquisitely sensitive to pharmacological complex I inhibition; and (iv) gamma oscillations utilize mitochondrial oxidative capacity near limit. These data suggest that gamma oscillations are especially energy demanding and require both high complex I expression and strong functional performance of mitochondria. Our study helps to explain the exceptional vulnerability of complex brain functions in ischaemia as well as in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders that are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.",

The NADH fluorescence increases rapidly over a narrow, very low pO(2) range with a p(50) of 3.4 \u00b1 0.6 mm\u2009Hg, thereby establishing a nearly binary reporter of significant, metabolically limiting hypoxia. The transient cortical tissue boundaries of NADH fluorescence exhibit remarkably delineated geometrical patterns, which define the limits of tissue oxygen diffusion from the cortical microcirculation and bear a striking resemblance to the ideal Krogh tissue cylinder. The visualization of microvessels and their regional contribution to oxygen delivery establishes penetrating arterioles as major oxygen sources in addition to the capillary network and confirms the existence of cortical oxygen fields with steep microregional oxygen gradients. Thus, two-photon NADH imaging can be applied to expose vascular supply regions and to localize functionally relevant microregional cortical hypoxia with micrometer spatial resolution.",

There is almost no recovery of the evoked population spike following 10 min of anoxia in slices from adult rats.2. A 2 h exposure of slices to creatine markedly improves the recovery of the population spike (80% vs. 5%). The creatine pre-incubation builds up phosphocreatine levels in the slice and prevents the large fall in ATP during anoxia; ATP falls to 7.9 rather than 3.6 nM/mg protein. The intracellular pH of both groups falls to the same level during anoxia.3. If calcium concentration in the medium is reduced to 0 while magnesium concentration is raised to 10 mM during anoxia the evoked response recovers to about 65%.4. The data suggest that an attenuation of the fall in ATP or entry of calcium during anoxia protects the tissue against irreversible transmission damage. Thus both of these factors participate in the generation of this damage. It is not yet clear if they act independently or if one acts by altering the other.5. In the post-anoxic recovery period the intracellular concentration of potassium is reduced by about 25%. However, it is still much higher than in slices that show only partial block of the evoked response when treated with ouabain. Therefore a fall in intracellular potassium 1 h after anoxia cannot explain the lack of recovery of the evoked response in adult tissue.6. ATP levels in the post-anoxic recovery period are reduced from their pre-anoxic levels (9.7 vs. 13.9 nM/mg protein). However when azide or antimycin A are used to directly reduce ATP to the level found 1 h after anoxia the evoked response is reduced by only about 45%. Thus the reduced post-anoxic ATP levels are not sufficient to explain the loss of the evoked response in adult tissue.7. The data show that the irreversible loss of transmission is not due to decreased cell ATP or to decreased cell K/Na levels 1 h after the anoxic period.8. Since creatine pre-incubation protects against irreversible transmission loss this compound or one closely related to it may prove useful in attenuating irreversible brain damage in situ.",

UCP1 (thermogenin) was first discovered in brown adipose tissue and is responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis. Expression of mRNA for three other UCP isoforms, UCP2, UCP4, and BMCP1/UCP5, has been found at high levels in brain. However, the physiological function(s) of UCPs in the brain have not been determined, although it has recently been postulated that UCPs regulate free radical flux from mitochondria by physiologically modulating mitochondrial membrane potential. In the CNS, this hypothesis has been studied primarily for UCP2. UCP2 message has been shown to be up-regulated in the CNS by stress signals such as kainate administration or ischemia, and overexpression of UCP2 has been reported to be neuroprotective against oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro, although the exact mechanism has not been fully established. In this review, studies on UCPs in the nervous system will be reviewed, and the potential roles of these intriguing proteins in acute and chronic diseases of the nervous system will be discussed.",

Small decreases in paO2, produced by forced ventilation of hypoxic gas mixtures, resulted in decreased amplitude of the characteristic negative shift in extracellular potential which accompanies such stimulation and smaller oxidative response of NADH and cytochrome oxidase. When paO2 fell below 40-50 Torr, stimulation produced reductive rather than oxidative shifts of the mitochondrial respiratory chain components. The data suggest that when arterial oxygen tension is slightly decreased, compensating mechanisms allow brain function to continue with minimal changes in cortical metabolites and high energy phosphate compounds. When arterial oxygen falls below 40-50 Torr, however, compensation can no longer prevent tissue hypoxia during times of increased energy demand. Thus, hypoxemia is not necessarily synonymous with oxygen insufficiency, but oxygen sufficiency must be defined with due regard to the degree of energy demand.",

Transmission between the perforant path and the dentate granule cells in the in vitro hippocampus was studied.2. Hippocampal slice ATP is decreased by approximately 15% at the time that the evoked response begins to diminish in standard Krebs bicarbonate buffer. This is about 2 min after the onset of hypoxia.3. When transmission failure is accelerated by increasing extracellular K(+) from 4.4 to 13.4 mM, the evoked response begins to decay about 30 sec after exposure to hypoxia. There is no decrease in hippocampal slice ATP at this time.4. However, ATP in the molecular layer (the synaptic region of the tissue) is decreased by approximately 15% at the time the evoked response begins to decay in the slices exposed to elevated K(+) concentration.5. Exposing the hippocampal slice to 25 mM-creatine for 3 hr elevates molecular layer phosphocreatine fourfold. Synaptic transmission during hypoxia survives three times as long as it does in the absence of creatine.6. In the creatine fortified medium, molecular layer ATP no longer declines within 30 sec of hypoxia. However the molecular layer ATP does decline within 90 sec of hypoxia, the time at which the evoked response begins to decay in this creatine-fortified buffer.7. The results establish that ATP in the region of the active synapses is lowered when the first signs of electrophysiological failure appear during hypoxia. They also show that maintaining ATP for longer than normal during hypoxia is associated with a prolonged maintenance of the evoked response. They thus suggest that a decline in ATP is one factor causing hypoxic block of synaptic transmission.8. It is further suggested that the very rapid failure of the electroencephalogram during anoxia may also result from a decline in ATP.",

When the cerebral was stimulated by trains of repeated electric pulses applied either directly to its surface or to an afferent pathway, the corrected cortical fluorescence (F-R) declined indicating oxidation of NADH, the activity of extracellular potassium [K+]o increased, and the extracellular potential (Vec) shifted in the negative direction. When mild to moderate stimuli not exceeding 10-15 sec in duration were used, a 3-fold correlation was found between these three variables. The regression of F-R over either Vec, or over log [K+]o had a positive ordinal intercept. The results are in agreement with earlier suggestions 4,24,25,43,45,46 that (a) much but not all the oxidative metabolic response of cortex to electrical stimulation is expended in restoring disturbed ion balance; and (b) that sustained shifts of potential (SP) in response to repetitive electrical stimulation are generated by glia cells depolarized by excess potassium. The magnitude of SP shifts associated with a given elevation of [k+]o are smaller in cerebral cortex than in spinal cord48,49. The correlation of F-R with [K+]o breaks down when pathologic processes of either seizure activity or spreading depression set in. During paroxysmal activity [K+]o tends to remain confined below 10-12 mM, a level observed in non-convulsing cortex as well, but oxidation of NADH progresses beyond that seen in non-convulsing cortex as well, but oxidation of NADH progresses beyond that seen in non-convulsing tissue. This observation is hard to reconcile with the suggestion that excess potassium is a factor in the generation of seizures, at least of the type observed in this study. When [K+]o levels exceeded 10-12 mM, spreading depression invariably followed at least under the unanesthetized condition in these experiments. During spreading depression [K+]o levels rose to exceed 30 mM, sometimes 80 mM. NADH was oxidized during spreading depression to a level comparable to that seen in seizures. The observations are compatible with the suggestion13 that spreading depression occurs whenever the release of potassium into extracellular fluid is overloading its clearance therefrom.",

Electrical hindlimb stimuli were applied for 1, 2, and 5 s to vary the duration of evoked cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMR(O(2))). The electrical stimulation induced a robust increase in Po(2) (4-9 Torr at peak) after an increase in LCBF (14-26% at peak). A consistent lag of approximately 1.2 s (0.6-2.3 s for individual animals) in the Po(2) relative to LCBF was found, irrespective of stimulus length. It is argued that the lag in Po(2) was predominantly caused by the time required for oxygen to diffuse through tissue. During brain functions, the supply of fresh oxygen further lagged because of the latency of LCBF onset ( approximately 0.4 s). The results indicate that the tissue oxygen supports excess demand until the arrival of fresh oxygen. However, a large drop in Po(2) was not observed, indicating that the evoked neural activity demands little extra oxygen or that the time course of excess demand is as slow as the increase in supply. Thus the dynamics of Po(2) during brain functions predominantly depend on the time course of LCBF. Possible factors influencing the lag between demand and supply are discussed, including vascular spacing, reactivity of the vessels, and diffusivity of oxygen.",

Understanding the quantitative relations between microvascular structure and functional activity is therefore significant to make a valid signal interpretation for the imaging techniques. In the present study, we evaluated depth profiles of microvascular distributions in rat somatosensory subfields (barrel field, forelimb region, trunk region and hindlimb region) and characterized depth variations in microvascular structures, such as locations, lengths and directions of microvessels, throughout the cortical layers (I-VI). To obtain the accurate microvascular structure, we made a customized casting method by using confocal laser scanning microscope. We observed that microvascular distribution successively varied throughout the cortical layers (I-VI) and that the maximum number density of microvessels was consistently found in middle layers (III-V). In addition, superficial layers had relatively long microvessels, almost perpendicular to the cortical surface, whereas middle layers had short microvessels propagating in all directions. These regional differences in microvascular structures were closely related to the somatosensory subfields, e.g., barrel field was the greatest number density of microvessels among the investigated subfields. Based on these observations, we compared microvascular profiles with previously reported distribution patterns of tissue partial pressure of oxygen (pO2). The results showed that tissue pO2 was correlated with microvascular distribution in some but not all of the subfields. This finding shows that detailed microvascular profiles are helpful to investigate causal relationships between microvascular structure and functional activities in cerebral cortex.",

To characterize the local Po2 response to the given neural activity, the authors simultaneously measured tissue Po2 and neural activity in the identical region of guinea pig auditory cortex with an oxygen microelectrode (tip &lt; 10 microm) and optical recording with voltage-sensitive dye (RH 795). In addition, a laser displacement gauge and a laser-Doppler flowmeter were used to monitor the spatial displacement and regional cerebral blood flow, respectively, in the Po2 measurement region. In the activated region, tissue Po2 initially decreased during the approximately 3-seconds after the onset of acoustic stimuli, and then increased during the next approximately 5 seconds. Such biphasic changes are consistently found in cortical layers I to IV. In addition, amplitude of the biphasic change was closely related to detected peak height of the optical signal changes. The results suggest that the initial decrease in tissue Po2 is coupled to the induced neural activity and depends on response time of local increase in cerebral blood flow.",

The changes in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) were also evaluated using a hypotension condition established by our group based on the administration of a vasodilator. Under normal conditions, CBF, PO2, and OIS showed positive signal changes (48%, 32%, and 0.42%, respectively) following stimulation. Over multiple trials, the CBF responses were well correlated with the integral of the LFP amplitudes (sigmaLFP) (Rmean=0.78), whereas a lower correlation was found between PO2 and sigmaLFP (Rmean=0.60) and between OIS and sigmaLFP (Rmean=0.54). Under the hypotension condition the LFP responses were preserved, but the CBF responses were suppressed and the PO2 and OIS changes were negative (-12% and -0.28%, respectively). In this condition, the trial-by-trial variations in PO2 and OIS were well correlated with the variability in sigmaLFPs (Rmean= -0.77 and -0.76, respectively), indicating a single trial coupling between CMRO2 changes and sigmaLFP.

    "abstxt": "The function of the nervous system relies upon synaptic transmission, a process in which a neurotransmitter released from pre-synaptic terminals of one neuron (in response to membrane depolarization and calcium influx) activates post-synaptic receptors on dendrites of another neuron. Synapses are subjected to repeated bouts of oxidative and metabolic stress as the result of changing ion gradients and ATP usage. Mitochondria play central roles in meeting the demands of synapses for ATP and in regulating calcium homeostasis, and mitochondrial dysfunction can cause dysfunction and degeneration of synapses, and can trigger cell death. We have identified two types of mitochondrial proteins that serve the function of protecting synapses and neurons against dysfunction and death. Mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (MitoKATP) channels modulate inner membrane potential and oxyradical production; mitochondrial potassium fluxes can affect cytochrome c release and caspase activation and may determine whether neurons live or die in experimental models of stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are a family of mitochondrial membrane proteins that uncouple electron transport from ATP production by transporting protons across the inner membrane. Neurons express at least three UCPs including the widely expressed UCP-2 and the neuron-specific UCP-4 and UCP-5 (BMCP-1). We have found that UCP-4 protects neurons against apoptosis by a mechanism involving suppression of oxyradical production and stabilization of cellular calcium homeostasis. The expression of UCP-4 is itself regulated by changes in energy metabolism. In addition to their roles in neuronal cell survival and death, MitoKATP channels and UCPs may play roles in regulating neuronal differentiation during development and synaptic plasticity in the adult.",

These conclusions have important consequences for understanding brain physiology as it is now being explored by techniques such as blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). It has been known for some time that most of the measured oxygen tensions are less than venous pO2 and are distributed in a spatially and temporally heterogeneous manner on a microregional scale. Although certain large-scale methods can provide reproducible average brain pO2 measurements, no useful concept of a characteristic oxygen tension or meaningful average value for brain tissue oxygen can be known on a microregional level. Only an oxygen field exists with large local gradients due to local tissue respiration, and the most useful way to express this is with a pO2 distribution curve or histogram. The neurons of the brain cortex normally exist in a low-oxygen environment and on activation are oxygenated by increases in local capillary blood flow that lead to increases in hemoglobin saturation and tissue oxygen.",

    "abstxt": "The brain requires a constant and substantial energy supply to maintain its main functions. For decades, it was assumed that glucose was the major if not the only significant source of energy for neurons. This view was supported by the expression of specific facilitative glucose transporters on cerebral blood vessels, as well as neurons. Despite the fact that glucose remains a key energetic substrate for the brain, growing evidence suggests a different scenario. Thus astrocytes, a major type of glial cells that express their own glucose transporter, play a critical role in coupling synaptic activity with glucose utilization. It was shown that glutamatergic activity triggers an enhancement of aerobic glycolysis in this cell type. As a result, lactate is provided to neurons as an additional energy substrate. Indeed, lactate has proven to be a preferential energy substrate for neurons under various conditions. A family of proton-linked carriers known as monocarboxylate transporters has been described and specific members have been found to be expressed by endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons. Moreover, these transporters are subject to fine regulation of their expression levels and localization, notably in neurons, which suggests that lactate supply could be adjusted as a function of their level of activity. Considering the importance of energetics in the aetiology of several neurodegenerative diseases, a better understanding of its cellular and molecular underpinnings might have important implications for the future development of neuroprotective strategies.",

    "abstxt": "Because of their high energetic demand, neurons within the mammalian central nervous system are extremely sensitive to changes in partial pressure of oxygen. Faced with acute hypoxic conditions, an organism must follow a complex and highly dynamic emergency plan to secure survival. Behavioral functions that are not immediately essential for survival are turned off, and critical behaviors (such as breathing) undergo a biphasic response. An augmentation of breathing is initially adaptive, whereas prolonged hypoxic conditions are better served by an energy-saving mode. However, the hypoxic response of an organism depends on many additional factors. Environmental conditions, the animal's age and health, and the pattern (continuous vs intermittent) and duration (chronic vs acute) of hypoxia greatly determine the specific course of a hypoxic response. Different forms of hypoxia can cause pathology or be used as therapy. Therefore, it is not surprising that the hypoxic response of an organism results from widespread and highly diverse reconfigurations of neuronal network functions in different brain areas that are accomplished by diverse hypoxic changes at all levels of the nervous system (i.e., molecular, cellular, synaptic, neuronal, network). Hypoxia-induced changes in synaptic transmission are generally depressive and result primarily from presynaptic mechanisms, whereas changes in intrinsic properties involve excitatory and inhibitory alterations involving the majority of K+, Na+, and Ca2+ channels. This article reviews the response of the nervous system to hypoxia, accounting for all levels of integration from the cellular to the network level, and postulates that a better understanding of the diversity of cellular events is only possible if cellular and network events are considered in a functional and organismal context.",

    "abstxt": "1. In some classes of central neurons, repetitive synaptic stimulation induces substantial changes in the postsynaptic membrane, in conjunction with robust frequency potentiation of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). However, the nature and time course of these postsynaptic membrane shifts, or their possible contributions to EPSP frequency potentiation (e.g., by altering driving force or current pathways), have not been examined extensively. We therefore studied the simultaneous patterns of change in composite EPSP amplitude, postsynaptic input resistance (Rin), and postsynaptic membrane potential during a 4-min train of 10-Hz monosynaptic stimulation in CA1 neurons of hippocampal slices. Slices were maintained in media containing either control (4 mM) or high (6.5 mM) concentrations of K+. 2. Potentiation of the EPSP, hyperpolarization of the membrane, and a decline of Rin, all developed rapidly during 10-Hz synaptic stimulation; these responses reached maximal levels by 5-15 s of the stimulation train. In most cells, a membrane depolarization phase occurred between 15 and 45 s of stimulation, followed by rehyperpolarization by 1 min of stimulation. During the depolarization phase, both EPSP potentiation and the decline in Rin remained near maximal. No significant differences were seen as a function of K+ concentrations. 3. These results show that hyperpolarization is not invariably associated temporally with EPSP frequency potentiation. Moreover, if driving force and membrane conductance changes are assumed to be approximately similar in large dendrites and soma, then the increase in driving force due to membrane hyperpolarization was not sufficient to account for the three- and fourfold increases in EPSP amplitude seen during frequency potentiation. Further, based on similar assumptions and on dendritic models of EPSP attenuation, the decline in Rin should reduce EPSP amplitude at the dendritic synaptic site and, to a proportionately greater extent, at the soma. 4. Studies in which the membrane was hyperpolarized with injected current to approximately the IPSP reversal potential, or in which bicuculline methiodide was applied to the slices, indicated that depression of the IPSP by repetitive stimulation did not account for frequency potentiation of EPSP amplitude. 5. These data are therefore consistent with the conclusion that the frequency potentiation of composite EPSPs in central neurons depends on presynaptic mechanisms, rather than on generalized postsynaptic changes. However, our findings do not rule out localized postsynaptic changes in receptors or spines as possible contributing factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The possibility that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase may catalyse a ;non-equilibrium' reaction is discussed. 3. Correlation of changes in concentrations of substrates for enzymes catalysing ;non-equilibrium' reactions with changes in rates of glycolysis caused by alteration of the conditions of incubation showed that hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and possibly glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase are subject to metabolic control in cerebral cortex slices. 4. It is suggested that the glycolysis is controlled by two regulatory systems, the hexokinase-phosphofructokinase system and the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-pyruvate kinase system.

If this hypothesis is correct, lactate must be the mitochondrial substrate for oxidative energy metabolism via its oxidation to pyruvate, plausibly by a mitochondrial LDH. Here we employed electrophysiology of the rat hippocampal slice preparation to test and monitor the effects of malonate and oxamate, two different LDH inhibitors, and glutamate, a neuronal activator, in experiments, the results of which support the hypothesis that lactate, at least in this in vitro setting, is indeed the principal end product of neuronal aerobic glycolysis.",

Autofluorescence excited by ultraviolet light has been most extensively studied, and is due to reduced pyridine nucleotides (NADH and NADPH, collectively termed NAD(P)H). Stimulation generates a characteristic compound NAD(P)H response, comprising an initial fluorescence decrease and then an overshooting increase that slowly recovers to baseline levels. Evoked NAD(P)H transients are relatively easy to record, do not require the addition of exogenous indicators and have good signal-noise ratios. These characteristics make NAD(P)H imaging methods very useful for tracking the spread of neuronal activity in complex brain tissues, however the cellular basis of synaptically-evoked autofluorescence transients has been the subject of recent debate. Of particular importance is the question of whether signals are due primarily to changes in neuronal mitochondrial function, and/or whether astrocyte metabolism triggered by glutamate uptake may be a significant contributor to the overshooting NAD(P)H fluorescence increases. This mini-review addresses the subcellular origins of NAD(P)H autofluorescence and the evidence for mitochondrial and glycolytic contributions to compound transients. It is concluded that there is no direct evidence for a contribution to NAD(P)H signals from glycolysis in astrocytes following synaptic glutamate uptake. In contrast, multiple lines of evidence, including from complimentary flavoprotein autofluorescence signals, imply that mitochondrial NADH dynamics in neurons dominate compound evoked NAD(P)H transients. These signals are thus appropriate for studies of mitochondrial function and dysfunction in brain slices, in addition to providing robust maps of postsynaptic neuronal activation following physiological activation.",

Increased slow-wave activity in ECoG preceded the onset of the FED at 3 and 5 ATA O2. During days 2 and 3 at 1 ATA O2 the ECoG mostly contained slow and low-amplitude waves.

In vitro studies have demonstrated these events are dependent on mitochondrial Ca(2+) cycling and that a reduction in membrane potential is sufficient to reduce excitotoxic cell death. This concept has gained additional support from experiments demonstrating that the overexpression of endogenous mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP), which decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential, decreases cell death following oxidative stress. Our group has demonstrated that upregulation of UCP activity can reduce excitotoxic-mediated ROS production and cell death whereas a reduction in UCP levels increases susceptibility to neuronal injury.

Astrocytic glycogen breakdown and lactate release are essential for long-term but not short-term memory formation, and for the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength elicited in vivo. Disrupting the expression of the astrocytic lactate transporters monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) or MCT1 causes amnesia, which, like LTP impairment, is rescued by L-lactate but not equicaloric glucose. Disrupting the expression of the neuronal lactate transporter MCT2 also leads to amnesia that is unaffected by either L-lactate or glucose, suggesting that lactate import into neurons is necessary for long-term memory. Glycogenolysis and astrocytic lactate transporters are also critical for the induction of molecular changes required for memory formation, including the induction of phospho-CREB, Arc, and phospho-cofilin. We conclude that astrocyte-neuron lactate transport is required for long-term memory formation.",

Using two-photon microscopic NADH imaging and oxygen sensor microelectrodes in live mouse cortex, we find that CSD is linked to severe hypoxia and marked neuronal swelling that can last up to several minutes. Changes in dendritic structures and loss of spines during CSD are comparable to those during anoxic depolarization. Increasing O2 availability shortens the duration of CSD and improves local redox state. Our results indicate that tissue hypoxia associated with CSD is caused by a transient increase in O2 demand exceeding vascular O2 supply.",

In the present study we determined the distributions of enantiomers of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) in rat brain, liver, heart, and kidney homogenates, and we found the heart homogenate contained an enriched amount of L-3HB (37.67 microM/mg protein) which generated a significant ratio of 66/34 (D/L). The ratio was altered to be 87/13 in the diabetic rat heart homogenate. We subsequently found this changed ratio of D/L-3HB may contribute to reduce glucose utilization in cardiomyocytes. Glucose utilization by cardiomyocytes with 5 mM of D-3HB was decreased to 61% of the control, but no interference was observed when D-3HB was replaced with L-3HB, suggesting L-3HB is not utilized for the energy fuel as other ketone bodies are. In addition, the reduced glucose utilization caused by D-3HB gradually recovered in a dose-dependent manner with administration of additional L-3HB. The results gave the necessity of taking L-3HB together with D-3HB into account with regard to glucose utilization, and L-3HB may be a helpful substrate for improving inhibited cardiac pyruvate oxidation caused by hyperketonemia.",

Whereas neurons possess highly oxidative metabolism and easily succumb to ischemia, astrocytes rely more on glycolytic metabolism and hence are less susceptible tolack of oxygen. Astrocytoma cells seem to retain basic metabolic mechanisms of astrocytes; for example, they show a high glycolytic rate, lactate extrusion, ability to flourish under hypoxia, and opportunistic use of mechanisms to enhance cell division and maintain growth. Differences in metabolism between neurons and astrocytes may also extend to astrocytoma cells, providing therapeutic opportunities against astrocytomas, including sensitivity to acetate, a high rate of glycolysis and lactate extrusion, glutamate uptake transporters, differential sensitivities of monocarboxylate transporters, presence of glycogen, high interlinking with gap junctions, use of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate for lipid synthesis, using different isoforms of synthetic enzymes (e.g. isocitrate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase), and different glucose uptake mechanisms.

The responses in vivo consist of a persistent oxidized state during neuronal activity followed by mild reduction during recovery. In vitro, however, brief oxidation is followed by prolonged and heightened reduction, even during persistent neuronal activation. In normally perfused, oxygenated and activated brain tissue in vivo, partial pressure of oxygen (P(O2)) levels often undergo a brief 'dip' that is always followed by an overshoot above baseline, due to increased blood flow (neuronal-vascular coupling). By contrast, in the absence of blood circulation, tissue P(O2)in vitro decreases more markedly and recovers slowly to baseline without overshooting. Although oxygen is abundant in vivo, it is diffusion-limited in vitro. The disparities in mitochondrial and tissue oxygen availability account for the different redox responses.",

Only then, in combination with normal mitochondrial function, sufficient energy (adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP)) can be produced. Glucose is virtually the sole fuel for the human brain. The brain lacks fuel stores and requires a continuous supply of glucose and oxygen. Therefore, continuous cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral oxygen tension and delivery, and normal mitochondrial function are of vital importance for the maintenance of brain function and tissue viability. This review focuses on three main issues: (1) Cerebral oxygen transport (CBF, and oxygen partial pressure (PO2) and delivery to the brain); (2) Energy metabolism (glycolysis, mitochondrial function: citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation); and (3) The role of the above in the pathophysiology of severe head injury. Basic understanding of these issues in the normal as well as in the traumatized brain is essential in developing new treatment strategies. These issues also play a key role in interpreting data collected from monitoring techniques such as cerebral tissue PO2, jugular bulb oxygen saturation (SjvO2), near infra red spectroscopy (NIRS), microdialysis, intracranial pressure monitoring (ICP), laser Doppler flowmetry, and transcranial Doppler flowmetry--both in the experimental and in the clinical setting.",

In vitro stable values are compared with in situ hippocampal levels. Regardless of the conditions under which slices were prepared, metabolite levels required up to 3 h to stabilize, and these levels were maintained or improved through 8 h of incubation. Further, the maximal concentrations of metabolites were independent of the conditions of slice preparation. Total adenylates and total creatine levels reached 55% of those in vivo. Lactate decreased from the decapitation-induced high levels, but stabilized at concentrations about twice those in rapidly frozen brain. Cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP exhibited peak levels at 30 min of incubation, and cyclic GMP remained elevated for 3 h. Although all three methods of slice preparation resulted in similar metabolite profiles on incubation, the initial decreases in high energy phosphates were delayed by chilling. Most striking, the slices prepared in the absence of glucose and oxygen exhibited much smaller orthodromic evoked potentials in the dentate gyrus.

    "abstxt": "Cerebral energy metabolism is a highly compartmentalized and complex process in which transcellular trafficking of metabolites plays a pivotal role. Over the past decade, a role for lactate in fueling the energetic requirements of neurons has emerged. Furthermore, a neuroprotective effect of lactate during hypoglycemia or cerebral ischemia has been reported. The majority of the current evidence concerning lactate metabolism at the cellular level is based on in vitro data; only a few recent in vivo results have demonstrated that the brain preferentially utilizes lactate over glucose. Using voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging, beta-probe measurements of radiotracer kinetics, and brain activation by sensory stimulation in the anesthetized rat, we investigated several aspects of cerebral lactate metabolism. The present study is the first in vivo demonstration of the maintenance of neuronal activity in the presence of lactate as the primary energy source. The loss of the voltage-sensitive dye signal found during severe insulin-induced hypoglycemia is completely prevented by lactate infusion. Thus, lactate has a direct neuroprotective effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the brain readily oxidizes lactate in an activity-dependent manner. The washout of 1-[(11)C]L-lactate, reflecting cerebral lactate oxidation, was observed to increase during brain activation from 0.077 \u00b1 0.009 to 0.105 \u00b1 0.007 min(-1). Finally, our data confirm that the brain prefers lactate over glucose as an energy substrate when both substrates are available. Using [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to measure the local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose, we demonstrated a lactate concentration-dependent reduction of cerebral glucose utilization during experimentally increased plasma lactate levels.",

    "abstxt": "Temporary block of glycolysis by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) reversibly suppresses synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices. Recovery of responses is followed by a sustained potentiation of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) (2-DG-LTP). To investigate the mechanisms involved in this type of LTP, we studied the effects of 2-DG on membrane properties of CA1 neurons (in slices from Sprague-Dawley rats), recorded with sharp intracellular electrodes containing 3 M KCl, as well as patch electrodes, filled mainly with 150 mM KMeSO4 and Hepes. The predominant change produced by 15- to 20-min applications of 2-DG (10 mM, replacing glucose) was hyperpolarization (-5.6 +/- 1.1 mV for 18 intracellular recordings and -7.2 +/- 0.80 mV for 17 whole-cell recordings) accompanied by a fall in resistance (-33 +/- 2.5% for 14 intracellular recordings and -11.6 +/- 7.1% for 15 whole-cell recordings). Virtually identical hyperpolarizations were recorded in the presence of 20 microM glyburide (-5.5 +/- 1.5 mV, n = 6), but they were abolished by adenosine antagonists 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline (8-SPT) and 8-cyclopentyl-3,7-dihydro-1,3-dipropyl-1H-purine-2,6-dione (DPCPX) (2.8 +/- 1.6 and 4.0 +/- 1.7 mV, respectively; n = 5 for both). It was concluded that the hyperpolarization is most likely caused by an increase in K+ conductance, activated by a 2-DG-induced rise in adenosine release. After such applications of 2-DG, a sustained potentiation of EPSPs (similar to the 2-DG-LTP of field EPSPs) was evident in five neurons recorded with intracellular electrodes but not in any of nine whole-cell recordings, where it was replaced by sustained, LTD-like depression. We conclude that a factor essential for 2-DG-LTP induction is lost during whole-cell recording.",

    "abstxt": "The energy demands of the brain are exceptionally high compared with any other organ of the body. A complex control system maintains brain energy homeostasis, mobilizing appropriate energy substrates to satisfy the energy requirements. It is a common belief that many fundamental neuronal properties, including those governing excitability, are dependent on the energy supply. However, surprisingly little is known about how the specific factors underlying neuronal activity are affected by energy status. Most of these parameters have been studied in acute brain slices, in which the homeostatic system is absent and neurons in the artificial extracellular milieu are arbitrarily supplied with energy substrates. In this paper, we discuss the relationships between availability of energy substrates and neuronal excitability, and suggest that for in vitro studies, it is crucial to optimize the composition of the energy pool in the extracellular milieu.",

    "abstxt": "The extent to which brain slices reflect the energetic status of the in vivo brain has been a subject of debate. We addressed this issue to investigate the recovery of energetic parameters and adenine nucleotides in rat hippocampal slices and the influence this has on synaptic transmission and plasticity. We show that, although adenine nucleotide levels recover appreciably within 10 min of incubation, it takes 3 h for a full recovery of the energy charge (to \u2265 0.93) and that incubation of brain slices at 34\u00b0C results in a significantly higher ATP/AMP ratio and a threefold lower activity of AMP-activated protein kinase compared with slices incubated at room temperature. Supplementation of artificial CSF with d-ribose and adenine (Rib/Ade) increased the total adenine nucleotide pool of brain slices, which, when corrected for the influence of the dead cut edges, closely approached in vivo values. Rib/Ade did not affect basal synaptic transmission or paired-pulse facilitation but did inhibit long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by tetanic or weak theta-burst stimulation. This decrease in LTP was reversed by strong theta-burst stimulation or antagonizing the inhibitory adenosine A(1) receptor suggesting that the elevated tissue ATP levels had resulted in greater activity-dependent adenosine release during LTP induction. This was confirmed by direct measurement of adenosine release with adenosine biosensors. These observations provide new insight into the recovery of adenine nucleotides after slice preparation, the sources of loss of such compounds in brain slices, the means by which to restore them, and the functional consequences of doing so.",
