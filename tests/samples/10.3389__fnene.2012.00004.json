    "abstxt": "The pancreatic islets are richly innervated by parasympathetic, sympathetic and sensory nerves. Several different neurotransmitters are stored within the terminals of these nerves, both the classical neurotransmitters, acetylcholine and noradrenaline, and several neuropeptides. The neuropeptides, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, pituitary adenlyate cyclase activating polypeptide and gastrin releasing peptide are constituents of the parasympathetic nerves, whereas the neuropeptides galanin and neuropeptide Y are localised to sympathetic nerve terminals. Furthermore, the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide is localised to sensory nerves and cholecystokinin is also an islet neuropeptide, although the nature of the cholecystokinin nerves is not established. Stimulation of the autonomic nerves and treatment with neurotransmitters affect islet hormone secretion. Thus, insulin secretion is stimulated by parasympathetic nerves or their neurotransmitters and inhibited by sympathetic nerves or their neurotransmitters. The islet autonomic nerves seem to be of physiological importance in mediating the cephalic phase of insulin secretion, in synchronising the islets to function as a unit allowing oscillations of islet hormone secretion, and in optimising islet hormone secretion during metabolic stress, e.g. hypoglycaemia and neuroglycopenia. The autonomic nerves could also be involved in the islet adaptation to insulin resistance with possible implication for the development of glucose intolerance and Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. It is concluded that islet innervation, through the contribution of all branches of the autonomic nerves and several different neurotransmitters is of importance both for the physiology and pathophysiology of the islets.",

We review neurophysiological and modeling studies in monkey that support a new theory of LC-NE function. LC neurons exhibit two modes of activity, phasic and tonic. Phasic LC activation is driven by the outcome of task-related decision processes and is proposed to facilitate ensuing behaviors and to help optimize task performance (exploitation). When utility in the task wanes, LC neurons exhibit a tonic activity mode, associated with disengagement from the current task and a search for alternative behaviors (exploration). Monkey LC receives prominent, direct inputs from the anterior cingulate (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortices (OFC), both of which are thought to monitor task-related utility. We propose that these frontal areas produce the above patterns of LC activity to optimize utility on both short and long timescales.",

    "abstxt": "The main aim of the present study was to study the effects of morning and afternoon physical activities on cortisol responses in obese and lean women. Twenty women volunteered to participate in this study. Subjects were divided into an obese group (BMI =29.1 kg/m2) and a lean group (BMI =19 kg/m2). All subjects participated in an exercise program consisting of treadmill running at 65+/-2 % VO2max until exhaustion. In order to study effects of circadian rhythm, exercise was performed at a similar intensity and in similar environmental conditions at both 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM. Saliva specimens were collected at rest 20 minutes before activity and then immediately after the exercise in both morning and afternoon sessions. Morning and afternoon exercise resulted in a significant increase in salivary cortisol concentrations compared to basal levels in both lean and obese women (p&lt;0.05), though the change in cortisol concentrations were higher in lean. The aerobic function of lean and obese women in the morning and afternoon showed a significant increase of 13.8 % and 5.9 %; respectively, with lean being consistently higher than obese. In conclusion, the stress response to exercise is related to circadian rhythm and individual's body weight. Based on the results of this study, it is suggested that overweight women perform exercises in the afternoon to minimize the stress response for the exercise volume performed (Tab. 1, Fig. 3, Ref. 39).

Initial studies provided critical insight into the basic organization and properties of this system. More recent work identifies a complicated array of behavioral and electrophysiological actions that have in common the facilitation of processing of relevant, or salient, information. This involves two basic levels of action. First, the system contributes to the initiation and maintenance of behavioral and forebrain neuronal activity states appropriate for the collection of sensory information (e.g. waking). Second, within the waking state, this system modulates the collection and processing of salient sensory information through a diversity of concentration-dependent actions within cortical and subcortical sensory, attention, and memory circuits. Norepinephrine-dependent modulation of long-term alterations in synaptic strength, gene transcription and other processes suggest a potentially critical role of this neurotransmitter system in experience-dependent alterations in neural function and behavior. The ability of a given stimulus to increase locus coeruleus discharge activity appears independent of affective valence (appetitive vs. aversive). Combined, these observations suggest that the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system is a critical component of the neural architecture supporting interaction with, and navigation through, a complex world. These observations further suggest that dysregulation of locus coeruleus-noradrenergic neurotransmission may contribute to cognitive and/or arousal dysfunction associated with a variety of psychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, sleep and arousal disorders, as well as certain affective disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder. Independent of an etiological role in these disorders, the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system represents an appropriate target for pharmacological treatment of specific attention, memory and/or arousal dysfunction associated with a variety of behavioral/cognitive disorders.",

There was no effect of corticosterone on the levels of plasma insulin when the glucose concentrations were either basal or raised in response to the standard pulse of glucose. However, when glucose was infused a significantly reduced plasma level of insulin was detected after 60 min when the glucocorticoid was present and this level remained significantly reduced after the modulated pulse of glucose. Thus the infusion of corticosterone leads to an acute depression of the concentrations of insulin in the plasma and of their response to a glucose pulse only when the hormone acts in the presence of a concentration of glucose in the plasma that is insulin-stimulatory.",

Change in body mass index was assessed for multiple domains of psychosocial stress related to work, personal relationships, life constraints, and finances, controlling for other factors associated with weight gain. All analyses were stratified by sex and weighted to account for the complex survey design. Among men with high baseline body mass index, weight gain was associated with increasing levels of psychosocial stress related to job-related demands (P &lt; 0.001 for interaction with baseline body mass index), lack of skill discretion (P = 0.014), lack of decision authority (P = 0.026), and difficulty paying bills (P = 0.004).

Sleep stage was graded by continuous electroencephalogram, and systemic glucose turnover was estimated by isotope dilution. Brain glucose metabolism fell from 33.6 +/- 2.2 mumol/100 g per min (mean +/- SE) before sleep (2300 h) to a mean nadir of 24.3 +/- 1.1 mumol/100 g per min at 0300 h during sleep (P = 0.001). Corresponding rates of systemic glucose utilization fell from 13.2 +/- 0.8 to 11.0 +/- 0.5 mumol/kg per min (P = 0.003). Diminished brain glucose metabolism was the product of a reduced arteriovenous glucose difference, 0.643 +/- 0.024 to 0.546 +/- 0.020 mmol/liter (P = 0.002), and cerebral blood flow, 50.3 +/- 2.8 to 44.6 +/- 1.4 cc/100 g per min (P = 0.021).

Here we demonstrate that their inhibition by glucose is mediated by ion channels not previously implicated in central or peripheral glucose sensing: tandem-pore K(+) (K(2P)) channels. Importantly, we show that this electrical mechanism is sufficiently sensitive to encode variations in glucose levels reflecting those occurring physiologically between normal meals. Moreover, we provide evidence that glucose acts at an extracellular site on orexin neurons, and this information is transmitted to the channels by an intracellular intermediary that is not ATP, Ca(2+), or glucose itself. These results reveal an unexpected energy-sensing pathway in neurons that regulate states of consciousness and energy balance.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Rats were cannulated and bilateral guide cannulas inserted to the level of the VMH. Eight days later, the rats received a VMH microinjection of either 1) vehicle, 2) the K(ATP) channel opener diazoxide, 3) the K(ATP) channel closer glybenclamide, 4) diazoxide plus the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol, or 5) glybenclamide plus the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide (BIC) before performance of a hypoglycemic clamp. Throughout, VMH GABA levels were measured using microdialysis. RESULTS-As expected, diazoxide suppressed glucose infusion rates and increased glucagon and epinephrine responses, whereas glybenclamide raised glucose infusion rates in conjunction with reduced glucagon and epinephrine responses. These effects of K(ATP) modulators were reversed by GABA(A) receptor agonism and antagonism, respectively. Microdialysis revealed that VMH GABA levels decreased 22% with the onset of hypoglycemia in controls. Diazoxide caused a twofold greater decrease in GABA levels, and glybenclamide increased VMH GABA levels by 57%. CONCLUSIONS-Our data suggests that K(ATP) channels within the VMH may modulate the magnitude of counterregulatory responses by altering release of GABA within that region.",

Potential involvement of CRFR1 was assessed through five daily sc injections of a CRFR1 antagonist (CP-154,526) prior to hypoxia. Results showed that the levels of body weight, food intake, blood glucose, and plasma insulin were significantly reduced; the content of hepatic glycogen initially and transiently declined, whereas the early plasma glucagon and leptin remarkably increased; plasma corticosterone was markedly increased throughout the hypoxic exposure of 1-15 d. Compared with hypoxia alone, CRFR1 antagonist pretreatment in the hypoxic groups prevented the rise in corticosterone, whereas the levels of body weight and food intake were unchanged. At the same time, the reduction in blood glucose was greater and the pancreatic glucose was increased, plasma insulin reverted toward control, and plasma glucagon decreased. In summary, prolonged hypoxia reduced body weight, food intake, blood glucose, and plasma insulin but transiently enhanced plasma glucagon and leptin. In conclusion, CRFR1 is potentially involved in the plasma insulin reduction and transient glucagon increase in hypoxic rats.",

Acutely (within hours), glucocorticoids (GCs) directly inhibit further activity in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, but the chronic actions (across days) of these steroids on brain are directly excitatory. Chronically high concentrations of GCs act in three ways that are functionally congruent. (i) GCs increase the expression of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA in the central nucleus of the amygdala, a critical node in the emotional brain. CRF enables recruitment of a chronic stress-response network. (ii) GCs increase the salience of pleasurable or compulsive activities (ingesting sucrose, fat, and drugs, or wheel-running). This motivates ingestion of &quot;comfort food.&quot; (iii) GCs act systemically to increase abdominal fat depots. This allows an increased signal of abdominal energy stores to inhibit catecholamines in the brainstem and CRF expression in hypothalamic neurons regulating adrenocorticotropin. Chronic stress, together with high GC concentrations, usually decreases body weight gain in rats; by contrast, in stressed or depressed humans chronic stress induces either increased comfort food intake and body weight gain or decreased intake and body weight loss. Comfort food ingestion that produces abdominal obesity, decreases CRF mRNA in the hypothalamus of rats. Depressed people who overeat have decreased cerebrospinal CRF, catecholamine concentrations, and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal activity. We propose that people eat comfort food in an attempt to reduce the activity in the chronic stress-response network with its attendant anxiety. These mechanisms, determined in rats, may explain some of the epidemic of obesity occurring in our society.",

The results suggest three organizing principles of these connections. First, the central nucleus, and certain other amygdalar cell groups associated with the main olfactory system, innervate preferentially various parts of the lateral and medial halves of the bed nuclear anterior division, and these projections travel via both the stria terminalis and ansa peduncularis (ventral pathway). Second, in contrast, the medial nucleus, and the rest of the amygdalar cell groups associated with the accessory and main olfactory systems innervate preferentially the posterior division, and the medial half of the anterior division, of the bed nuclei. And third, the lateral and anterior basolateral nuclei of the amygdala (associated with the frontotemporal association cortical system) do not project significantly to the bed nuclei. For comparison, inputs to the bed nuclei from the ventral subiculum, infralimbic area, and endopiriform nucleus are also described. The functional significance of these projections is discussed with reference to what is known about the output of the bed nuclei.",

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to asses the effect of childhood obesity on the counterregulatory hormonal response to acute exercise. Twenty-five obese children (Ob; body mass index &gt; 95%), and 25 age, gender, and maturity-matched normal-weight controls (NW) participated in the study. Exercise consisted of ten 2-min bouts of constant-cycle ergometry above the anaerobic threshold, with 1-min rest intervals between each bout. Pre-, post-, and 120-min postexercise blood samples were collected for circulating components of the GH-IGF-I axis and catecholamines. There were no differences in peak exercise heart rate, serum lactate, and peak O2 uptake normalized to lean body mass between the groups. Obesity attenuated the GH response to exercise (8.9 +/- 1.1 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.7 ng/ml in NW and Ob participants, respectively; P &lt; 0.02). No significant differences in the response to exercise were found for other components of the GH-IGF-I axis. Obesity attenuated the catecholamine response to exercise (epinephrine: 52.5 +/- 12.7 vs. 18.7 +/- 3.7 pg/ml, P &lt; 0.02; norepinephrine: 479.5 +/- 109.9 vs. 218.0 +/- 26.0 pg/ml, P &lt; 0.04; dopamine: 17.2 +/- 2.9 vs. 3.5 +/- 1.9 pg/ml, P &lt; 0.006 in NW and Ob, respectively). Insulin levels were significantly higher in the obese children and dropped significantly after exercise in both groups. Despite the elevated insulin levels and the blunted counterregulatory response, none of the participants developed hypoglycemia. Childhood obesity was associated with attenuated GH and catecholamine response to acute exercise. These abnormalities were compensated for, so that exercise was not associated with hypoglycemia, despite increased insulin levels in obese children.",

Limited information is available regarding potential adaptations or abnormalities in anaerobic metabolism and glucose homeostasis. Whole-body glucose production was assessed at rest and during exercise in COPD patients with moderate disease severity (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, 52% \u00b1 3%), prestratified into normal-weight (n = 7; body mass index [BMI], 27.5 \u00b1 0.9 kg\u00b7m(-2)) and underweight subjects (n = 6; BMI, 20.6 \u00b1 0.7 kg\u00b7m(-2)), and in 8 healthy controls matched for age and BMI with the normal-weight COPD group. Glucose tolerance was normal in all subjects. Rate of appearance (R(a)) of glucose at rest and during submaximal cycling exercise was measured in postabsorptive state by infusion of stable isotope tracer [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose. Resting glucose R(a) was significantly enhanced in underweight COPD patients compared with controls (16.7 \u00b1 0.3 vs 15.1 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcmol\u00b7kg fat-free mass(-1)\u00b7min(-1), P &lt; .05) and was inversely related to fat-free mass (r = -0.75, P &lt; .01). Furthermore, the exercise-induced increase in glucose R(a) was enhanced in COPD patients (81.9% \u00b1 3.4% vs 72.1% \u00b1 2.0%, P = .05), resulting in elevated end-of-exercise glucose output. Differences were most pronounced in underweight patients, who were also characterized by enhanced plasma catecholamine levels and decreased insulin concentrations (all, P &lt; .05). In normal-weight patients, there was evidence for decreased insulin sensitivity assessed by homeostatic modeling technique. Whole-body glucose production is increased in underweight COPD patients with normal glucose tolerance. It is hypothesized that lowered body weight in COPD has unique effects on glucose uptake despite reduced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, relative hypoxemia, and sympathetic activation.",

    "abstxt": "Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often have difficulties with keeping their weight. The aim of this investigation was to study nutritional status in hospitalised Nordic COPD patients and to investigate the association between nutritional status and long-term mortality in this patient group. In a multicentre study conducted at four university hospitals (Reykjavik, Uppsala, Tampere and Copenhagen) hospitalised patients with COPD were investigated. Patient height, weight and lung function was recorded. Health status was assessed with St. George's Hospital Respiratory Questionnaire. After 2 years, mortality data was obtained from the national registers in each country. Of the 261 patients in the study 19% where underweight (BMI &lt;20), 41% were of normal weight (BMI 20-25), 26% were overweight (BMI 25-30) and 14% were obese. FEV(1) was lowest in the underweight and highest in the overweight group (p=0.001) whereas the prevalence of diabetes and cardio-vascular co-morbidity went the opposite direction. Of the 261 patients 49 (19%) had died within 2 years. The lowest mortality was found among the overweight patients, whereas underweight was related to increased overall mortality. The association between underweight in COPD-patients, and mortality remained significant after adjusting for possible confounders such as FEV(1) (hazard risk ratio (95% CI) 2.6 (1.3-5.2)). We conclude that COPD patients that are underweight at admission to hospital have a higher risk of dying within the next 2 years. Further studies are needed in order to show whether identifying and treating weight loss and depletion of fat-free mass (FFM) is a way forward in improving the prognosis for hospitalised COPD patients.",

In addition, it has been clinically reported that hyperglycemia can develop after stroke, but the detailed mechanisms underlying this are unknown. Here, we focused on the relationship between post-ischemic hyperglycemia and the development of neuronal damage. In particular, we investigated the time course of alterations in fasting blood glucose levels (FBG) and the development of neuronal damage, including neuronal death (the development of infarction), behavioral abnormality and memory disturbance, using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model mice. The neuronal death was observed from 6 h, reaching a maximum on day 3 and was gradually aggravated up to day 5 after MCAO. Interestingly, 12 h and 1 day after MCAO, FBG was significantly increased and insulin sensitivity and insulin secretory capacity were decreased on 1 day after MCAO. In addition, we found that the basal plasma insulin levels were significantly higher and adiponectin levels were significantly lower on day 1 in the MCAO group compared with the sham group. These results indicate that the development of glucose intolerance was observed on day 1. Importantly, the neuronal damage observed on day 3 was completely suppressed by continuous administration of insulin during the first 48 h after MCAO. These results suggest that the post-ischemic hyperglycemia in the early phase of ischemic stress may be involved in the development of neuronal damage.",

    "abstxt": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability for glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) was studied by the intravenous double-indicator method in nine healthy subjects before and after 3.5 days of starvation. In fasting, mean arterial plasma glucose decreased and arterial concentration of beta-OHB increased, whereas cerebral blood flow remained unchanged. The permeability-surface area product for BBB glucose transport from blood to brain (PS1) increased by 55 +/- 31%, whereas no significant change in the permeability from brain back to blood (PS2) was found. PS1 for beta-OHB remained constant during starvation. The expected increase in PS1 due to the lower plasma glucose concentration was calculated to be 22% using previous estimates of maximal transport velocity and Michaelis-Menten affinity constant for glucose transport. The determined increase was thus 33% higher than the expected increase and can only be partially explained by the decrease in plasma glucose. It is concluded that a modest upregulation of glucose transport across the BBB takes place after starvation. Brain transport of beta-OHB did not decrease as expected from the largely increased beta-OHB arterial level. This might be interpreted as an increase in brain transport of beta-OHB, which could be caused by induction mechanisms, but the large nonsaturable component of beta-OHB transport makes such a conclusion difficult. However, beta-OHB blood concentration and beta-OHB influx into the brain increased by &gt; 10 times. This implies that the influx of ketone bodies into the brain is largely determined by the amount of ketones present in the blood, and any condition in which ketonemia occurs will lead to an increased ketone influx.",

In this experiment, the mood of 44 healthy young women (all oral contraceptive users) was examined. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled time series paradigm was used. Subjects were treated with either 30-mg cortisol or placebo orally. Forty-five minutes later, subjects attended a psychosocial stress procedure (Trier Social Stress Test; TSST; C. Kirschbaum, K. M. Pirke, &amp; D. H. Hellhammer, 1993). The course of the subjects' mood as well as salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase levels were measured before and after the TSST. With regard to mood, it was found that the groups did not differ in mood before the TSST. After stress exposure, the subjective ratings of current mood state of cortisol-treated women were significantly less negative than that of placebo-treated subjects. These findings show that raising cortisol levels prior to acute stress has a protective effect on mood during stress situations. Results are discussed with regard to the context of specific adaptive effects of cortisol and the role of cortisol in posttraumatic stress disorder.",

    "abstxt": "During acute mental stress, the energy supply to the human brain increases by 12%. To determine how the brain controls this demand for energy, 40 healthy young men participated in two sessions (stress induced by the Trier Social Stress Test and non-stress intervention). Subjects were randomly assigned to four different experimental groups according to the energy provided during or after stress intervention (rich buffet, meager salad, dextrose-infusion and lactate-infusion). Blood samples were frequently taken and subjects rated their autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms by standard questionnaires. We found that stress increased carbohydrate intake from a rich buffet by 34 g (from 149 +/- 13 g in the non-stress session to 183 +/- 16 g in the stress session; P &lt; 0.05). While these stress-extra carbohydrates increased blood glucose concentrations, they did not increase serum insulin concentrations. The ability to suppress insulin secretion was found to be linked to the sympatho-adrenal stress-response. Social stress increased concentrations of epinephrine 72% (18.3 +/- 1.3 vs. 31.5 +/- 5.8 pg/ml; P &lt; 0.05), norepinephrine 148% (242.9 +/- 22.9 vs. 601.1 +/- 76.2 pg/ml; P &lt; 0.01), ACTH 184% (14.0 +/- 1.3 vs. 39.8 +/- 7.7 pmol/l; P &lt; 0.05), cortisol 131% (5.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 12.4 +/- 1.3 mug/dl; P &lt; 0.01) and autonomic symptoms 137% (0.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.6; P &lt; 0.05). Exogenous energy supply (regardless of its character, i.e., rich buffet or energy infusions) was shown to counteract a neuroglycopenic state that developed during stress. Exogenous energy did not dampen the sympatho-adrenal stress-responses. We conclude that the brain under stressful conditions demands for energy from the body by using a mechanism, which we refer to as &quot;cerebral insulin suppression&quot; and in so doing it can satisfy its excessive needs.",

The 'Trier Social Stress Test' (TSST) mainly consists of an anticipation period (10 min) and a test period (10 min) in which the subjects have to deliver a free speech and perform mental arithmetic in front of an audience. In six independent studies this protocol has been found to induce considerable changes in the concentration of ACTH, cortisol (serum and saliva), GH, prolactin as well as significant increases in heart rate. As for salivary cortisol levels, the TSST reliably led to 2- to 4-fold elevations above baseline with similar peak cortisol concentrations. Studies are summarized in which TSST-induced cortisol increases elucidated some of the multiple variables contributing to the interindividual variation in adrenocortical stress responses. The results suggest that gender, genetics and nicotine consumption can influence the individual's stress responsiveness to psychological stress while personality traits showed no correlation with cortisol responses to TSST stimulation. From these data we conclude that the TSST can serve as a tool for psychobiological research.",

One popular model suggests that stress or GC treatment enhances memory consolidation while impairing delayed memory retrieval. Studies in humans have documented that treatment with GCs impairs delayed memory retrieval. Similar alterations after exposure to stress have not been observed thus far. In the present study, 19 young healthy male subjects were exposed to either a standardized psychosocial laboratory stressor (Trier Social Stress Test) or a control condition in a crossover manner. After both treatments, retrieval of a word list (learned 24 h earlier) containing 10 neutral, 10 negative, and 10 positive words was tested. The stressor induced a significant increase in salivary free cortisol and a decrease in mood. Memory retrieval (free recall) was significantly impaired after the stress condition. Follow-up analysis revealed that negative and positive words (i.e., emotionally arousing words) were affected, whereas no effect was observed for neutral words. No changes were detected for cued recall, working memory, or attention. The present study thus demonstrates that psychosocial stress impairs memory retrieval in humans and suggests that emotionally arousing material is especially sensitive to this effect.",

Previous electrophysiological findings demonstrating that tonic CRF secretion in the LC is increased in adrenalectomized rats suggest that activity of certain CRF afferents to the LC is under inhibitory regulation by endogenous corticosteroids. The present study was designed to identify putative CRF afferents to the LC that may be regulated by glucocorticoids. Retrograde tract tracing from the rat LC and pericoerulear regions was combined with immunohistochemistry to visualize CRF and glucocorticoid receptors in the same sections of rat brain. The retrograde tracer, wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase coupled to gold (WGA-Au-HRP) was injected into either the nucleus LC or the rostrolateral pericoerulear region (peri-LC), where CRF-immunoreactive terminals have been demonstrated to synapse with LC dendrites. Sections were processed to visualize the tracer, as well as CRF- and glucocorticoid receptor-immunoreactivity. Following injections of WGA-Au-HRP into the nuclear LC, triple labeled neurons were observed primarily in Barrington's nucleus, where 74+/-4% of retrogradely labeled CRF-immunoreactive neurons colocalized glucocorticoid receptor immunoreactivity. In contrast, injections that incorporated the rostrolateral peri-LC retrogradely labeled numerous neurons that were immunoreactive for both CRF and glucocorticoid receptors in the central nucleus of the amygdala. Thus, 94+/-2% of the retrogradely labeled CRF-immunoreactive neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala colocalized glucocorticoid receptor immunoreactivity. Additionally, triple labeled neurons were observed in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis following WGA-Au-HRP injections that incorporated the rostrolateral peri-LC. The present results implicate Barrington's nucleus, the central nucleus of the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis as glucocorticoid-sensitive sources of CRF that can influence the LC-noradrenergic system. Alterations in glucocorticoid levels or glucocorticoid receptor function would be predicted to affect the impact of these specific CRF systems on LC activity.",

One-half of the rats of each phenotype were subjected to moderate daily, unpredictable stress (cage changing, exposure to conspecific, swim, and immobilization stress, intraperitoneal saline injection) during the 5 wk. Both stressed and unstressed DIO rats were 26% heavier and ate 27% more than comparable DR rats at onset and had 48% lower basal morning plasma corticosterone levels. Stressed DR rats gained less weight and had significant elevations of basal morning corticosterone but reduced basal sympathetic activity (24-h urine norepinephrine) over 5 wk compared with their unstressed DR controls. Terminally, there was a 35% increase in the paraventricular nucleus corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA expression. On the other hand, stressed DIO rats showed only a transient early increase in open-field activity and a terminal increase in basal corticosterone levels as the only effects of stress. Thus DIO rats are hyporesponsive to chronic stress compared with DR rats. This is in keeping with several other known differences in hypothalamopituitary and autonomic function in this model.",

Global CMRO2 was unchanged during cerebral activation, whereas global CBF and global CMRglc both increased by 12%, reducing the molar ratio of oxygen to glucose consumption from 6.0 during baseline conditions to 5.4 during activation. Data obtained in the period following cerebral activation showed that the activation-induced resetting of the relation between CMRglc and CMRO2 persisted virtually unaltered for &gt; or = 40 min after the mental activation task was terminated. The activation-induced increase in cerebral lactate efflux measured over the same time period accounted for only a small fraction of the activation-induced excess glucose uptake. These data confirm earlier reports that brain activation can induce resetting of the cerebral oxygen/glucose consumption ratio, and indicate that the resetting persists for a long period after cerebral activation has been terminated and physiologic stress indicators returned to baseline values. Activation-induced resetting of the cerebral oxygen/glucose uptake ratio is not necessarily accounted for by increased lactate production from nonoxidative glucose metabolism.",

Rat pups were divided into three levels of postnatal stress from postnatal day (P) 3 to P7. All rats underwent unilateral brain injury on either P7 or P134. We measured brain injury, growth, blood pressure, urine/plasma CS, plasma leptin, insulin, and glucose before and after H-I. Postnatal stress increased neonatal CS production, exacerbated neonatal white matter injury, and was associated with adult hyperglycemia after H-I despite increased insulin production. There were no group differences in adult weight, blood pressure, or leptin. Postnatal stress exacerbated brain injury and produced adult hyperglycemia, triggered after hypoxia exposure, consistent with the hypotheses that neonates exposed to early stress are more vulnerable to hypoxia and may be predisposed to develop metabolic syndrome in adulthood. Prolonged maternal separation produced more hyperglycemia than did brief daily handling.",

Although pancreatic alpha-cells were functional in Kir6.2-/-, the mice exhibited a severe defect in glucagon secretion in response to systemic hypoglycemia. In addition, they showed a complete loss of glucagon secretion, together with reduced food intake in response to neuroglycopenia. Thus, our results demonstrate that KATP channels are important in glucose sensing in VMH GR neurons, and are essential for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.",

Therefore, we studied the effects of catecholamines on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We found that epinephrine (1 microM) nearly halved insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (0.3 microM) completely antagonized the inhibitory effect of epinephrine on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, whereas the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (10 microM) had no effect. When norepinephrine was used instead of epinephrine, the results were identical. None of the individual selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (1 microM, beta(1): metoprolol, beta(2): ICI-118551, beta(3): SR-59230A) could counteract the inhibitory effect of epinephrine. Combination of ICI-118551 and SR-59230A, as well as combination of all three selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, abolished the effect of epinephrine on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. After differential centrifugation, we measured the amount of GLUT1 and GLUT4 in the plasma membrane and in intracellular vesicles by means of Western blotting. Both epinephrine and norepinephrine reduced insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. These results show that beta-adrenergic (but not alpha-adrenergic) stimulation inhibits insulin-induced glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, most likely via the beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor by interfering with GLUT4 translocation from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane.",

Also a 0.3 degree C degree fall in tympanic temperature during cold exposure induced a significantly smaller increase in energy expenditure and a reduced plasma noradrenaline response in the obese subjects. Six obese and six normal weight persons performed aerobic bicycle training for five weeks, and the tests were repeated. Bicycle ergometer training for one hour per day (heart rate 140-160 bpm) for five weeks increased the maximal oxygen uptake by 13% and 12% (P &lt; 0.05) in the obese and the normal weight subjects, respectively.

Here we present a logistic approach, which is based on the principles of supply and demand known from economics. In this &quot;cerebral supply chain&quot; model, the brain constitutes the final consumer. In order to illustrate the operating mode of the cerebral supply chain, we take experimental data which allow assessing the supply, demand and need of the brain under conditions of psychosocial stress. The experimental results show that the brain under conditions of psychosocial stress actively demands energy from the body, in order to cover its increased energy needs. The data demonstrate that the stressed brain uses a mechanism referred to as &quot;cerebral insulin suppression&quot; to limit glucose fluxes into peripheral tissue (muscle, fat) and to enhance cerebral glucose supply. Furthermore psychosocial stress elicits a marked increase in eating behavior in the post-stress phase. Subjects ingested more carbohydrates without any preference for sweet ingredients. These experimentally observed changes of cerebral demand, supply and need are integrated into a logistic framework describing the supply chain of the selfish brain.",

Here we present the unconventional concept that a healthy organism is maintained by a &quot;competent brain-pull&quot; which serves systemic homeostasis, and that the underlying cause of obesity is &quot;incompetent brain-pull&quot;, i.e. that the brain is unable to properly demand glucose from the body. We describe the energy fluxes from the environment, through the body, towards the brain with a mathematical &quot;supply chain&quot; model and test whether its predictions fit medical and experimental data sets from our and other research groups. In this way, we show data-based support of our hypothesis, which states that under conditions of food abundance incompetent brain-pull will lead to build-ups in the supply chain culminating in obesity and type 2 diabetes. In the same way, we demonstrate support of the related hypothesis, which states that under conditions of food deprivation a competent brain-pull mechanism is indispensable for the continuance of the brain s high energy level. In conclusion, we took the viewpoint of integrative physiology and provided evidence for the necessity of brain-pull mechanisms for the benefit of health. Along these lines, our work supports recent molecular findings from the field of neuroenergetics and continues the work on the &quot;Selfish Brain&quot; theory dealing with the maintenance of the cerebral and peripheral energy homeostasis.",

    "abstxt": "The brain takes a primary position in the organism. We present the novel view that the brain gives priority to controlling its own adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration. It fulfils this tenet by orchestrating metabolism in the organism. The brain activates an energy-on-request system that directly couples cerebral supply with cerebral need. The request system is hierarchically organized among the cerebral hemispheres, the hypothalamus, and peripheral somatomotor, autonomic-visceromotor, and the neuroendocrine-secretomotor neurons. The system initiates allocative behavior (i.e. allocation of energy from body to brain), ingestive behavior (intake of energy from the immediate environment), or exploratory behavior (foraging in the distant environment). Cerebral projections coordinate all three behavioral strategies in such a way that the brain's energy supply is guaranteed continuously. In an ongoing learning process, the brain's request system adapts to various environmental conditions and stressful challenges. Disruption of a cerebral energy-request pathway is critical to the development of obesity: if the brain fails to receive sufficient energy from the peripheral body, it compensates for the undersupply by increasing energy intake from the immediate environment, leaving the body with a surplus. Obesity develops in the long term.",

In contrast, the opioid peptide dynorphin (DYN) has been shown to serve as a co-transmitter with CRF in afferents to the LC. To further define anatomical substrates targeting noradrenergic neurons by DYN afferents originating from limbic sources, anterograde tract-tracing of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) from the central amygdaloid complex was combined with immunocytochemical detection of DYN and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the same section of tissue. Triple labeling immunocytochemistry was combined with electron microscopy in the LC where BDA was identified using an immunoperoxidase marker, and DYN and TH were distinguished by the use of sequential immunogold labeling and silver enhancement to produce different sized gold particles. Results show direct evidence of a monosynaptic pathway linking amygdalar DYN afferents with LC neurons. To determine whether DYN-containing amygdalar LC-projecting neurons colocalize CRF, retrograde tract-tracing using fluorescent latex microspheres injected into the LC was combined with immunocytochemical detection of DYN and CRF in single sections in the central amygdala. Retrogradely labeled neurons from the LC were distributed throughout the rostro-caudal extent of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) as previously described. Cell counts showed that approximately 42% of LC-projecting neurons in the CeA contained both DYN and CRF. Taken with our previous studies showing monosynaptic projections from amygdalar CRF neurons to noradrenergic LC cells, the present study extends this by showing that DYN and CRF are co-transmitters in monosynaptic projections to the LC and are poised to coordinately impact LC neuronal activity.",

Our objective was to investigate the effect of acute and psychological stress on food intake, using the eating in the absence of hunger paradigm, in normal and overweight men and women (while taking dietary restraint and disinhibition into account). In 129 subjects (BMI = 24.5 +/- 3.4 kg/m(2) and age = 27.6 +/- 8.8 years), scores were determined on the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (dietary restraint = 7.2 +/- 4.4; disinhibition = 4.5 +/- 2.6; feeling of hunger = 3.9 +/- 2.6) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (trait score = 31.7 +/- 24.2). In a randomized crossover design, the &quot;eating in absence of hunger&quot; protocol was measured as a function of acute stress vs. a control task and of state anxiety scores. Energy intake from sweet foods (708.1 kJ vs. 599.4 kJ, P &lt; 0.03) and total energy intake (965.2 kJ vs. 793.8 kJ, P &lt; 0.01) were significantly higher in the stress condition compared to the control condition. Differences in energy intake between the stress and control condition were a function of increase in state anxiety scores during the stress task (Delta state anxiety scores) (R(2) = 0.05, P &lt; 0.01). This positive relationship was stronger in subjects with high disinhibition scores (R(2) = 0.12, P &lt; 0.05). Differences in state anxiety scores were a function of trait anxiety scores (R(2) = 0.07, P &lt; 0.05). We conclude that acute psychological stress is associated with eating in the absence of hunger, especially in vulnerable individuals characterized by disinhibited eating behavior and sensitivity to chronic stress.",

In this study, we sought to directly examine the effect of insulin on glucose concentrations and rates of glucose transport/metabolism in human brain using (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 4 Tesla. Seven subjects participated in paired hyperglycemic (16.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/l) clamp studies performed with and without insulin. Brain glucose remained constant throughout (5.3 +/- 0.3 micromol/g wet wt when serum insulin = 16 +/- 7 pmol/l vs. 5.5 +/- 0.3 micromol/g wet wt when serum insulin = 668 +/- 81 pmol/l, P = NS). Glucose concentrations in gray matter-rich occipital cortex and white matter-rich periventricular tissue were then simultaneously measured in clamps, where plasma glucose ranged from 4.4 to 24.5 mmol/l and insulin was infused at 0.5 mU. kg(-1). min(-1). The relationship between plasma and brain glucose was linear in both regions. Reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics fit these data best, and no differences were found in the kinetic constants calculated for each region. These data support the hypothesis that the majority of cerebral glucose uptake/metabolism is an insulin-independent process in humans.",

We hypothesized that consumption of an HF diet activates HPA axis by increasing norepinephrine (NE) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, leading to elevation in corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) concentration in the median eminence (ME) resulting in elevated serum corticosterone (CORT).",

It has been proposed that leptin acts in the hypothalamus, the main control centre for satiety and energy expenditure. Mutations in leptin or the receptor isoform (Ob-R[L]) present in hypothalamic neurons result in profound obesity and symptoms of non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Here we show that leptin hyperpolarizes glucose-receptive hypothalamic neurons of lean Sprague-Dawley and Zucker rats, but is ineffective on neurons of obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats. This hyperpolarization is due to the activation of a potassium current, and is not easily recovered on removal of leptin, but is reversed by applying the sulphonylurea, tolbutamide. Single-channel recordings demonstrate that leptin activates an ATP-sensitive potassium (K[ATP]) channel. Our data indicate that the K(ATP) channel may function as the molecular end-point of the pathway following leptin activation of the Ob-R(L) receptor in hypothalamic neurons.",

Fasting muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) correlated positively with body fat (r = 0.73; P = 0.001) in Caucasians but not in Pima Indians, whereas the increase in MSNA during the OGTT correlated negatively with the percentage of body fat (r = -0.38, P = 0.03) independently of race. In each subject, the increase in MSNA over time correlated positively with the increase in plasma insulin levels, but the slopes of these relationships were inversely related to the percentage of body fat (r = -0.52, P = 0.003) independently of race. In conclusion, obesity is associated with a higher fasting sympathetic neural outflow to muscle but a blunted increase in response to an oral glucose load despite a larger increase in plasma insulin levels. This blunted response may represent another feature of the obesity/insulin resistance syndrome.",

Chow-fed selectively bred DIO and DR rats underwent three sequential 60-min bouts of IIH separated by 48 h. Glucose levels fell comparably, but DIO rats had 22-29% lower plasma epinephrine (Epi) levels during the first two bouts than DR rats. By the third trial, despite comparable Epi levels, DIO rats had lower 30-min glucose levels and rebounded less than DR rats 85 min after intravenous glucose. Although DIO rats gained more carcass and fat weight after 4 wk on an HE diet than DR rats, they were unaffected by prior IIH. Compared with controls, DR rats with prior IIH and HE diet had higher arcuate nucleus neuropeptide Y (50%) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC; 37%) mRNA and an inverse correlation (r = 0.85; P = 0.004) between POMC expression and body weight gain on the HE diet. These data suggest that DIO rats have a preexisting defect in their CRR to IIH but that IIH does not affect the expression of their hypothalamic neuropeptides or weight gain as it does in DR rats.",

Due to difficulties in assessing function in vivo, the roles of the fast-acting neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA are largely unknown. Synaptic vesicular transporters (VGLUTs for glutamate and VGAT for GABA) are required for vesicular uptake and, consequently, synaptic release of neurotransmitters. Ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) neurons are predominantly glutamatergic and express VGLUT2. To evaluate the role of glutamate release from VMH neurons, we generated mice lacking VGLUT2 selectively in SF1 neurons (a major subset of VMH neurons). These mice have hypoglycemia during fasting secondary to impaired fasting-induced increases in the glucose-raising pancreatic hormone glucagon and impaired induction in liver of mRNAs encoding PGC-1alpha and the gluconeogenic enzymes PEPCK and G6Pase. Similarly, these mice have defective counterregulatory responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and 2-deoxyglucose (an antimetabolite). Thus, glutamate release from VMH neurons is an important component of the neurocircuitry that functions to prevent hypoglycemia.",

    "abstxt": "Although hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation is generally considered to be the hallmark of the stress response, many of the same stimuli that initiate this response also activate the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system. Given its functional attributes, the parallel engagement of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis serves to coordinate endocrine and cognitive limbs of the stress response. The elucidation of stress-related afferents to the locus coeruleus and the electrophysiological characterization of these inputs are revealing how the activity of this system is fine-tuned by stressors to facilitate adaptive cognitive responses. Emerging from these studies, is a picture of complex interactions between the stress-related neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), endogenous opioids and the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter, glutamate. The net effect of these interactions is to adjust the activity and reactivity of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system such that state of arousal and processing of sensory stimuli are modified to facilitate adaptive behavioral responses to stressors. This review begins with an introduction to the basic anatomical and physiological characteristics of locus coeruleus neurons. The concept that locus coeruleus neurons operate through two activity modes, i.e., tonic vs. phasic, that determine distinct behavioral strategies is emphasized in light of its relevance to stress. Anatomical and physiological evidence are then presented suggesting that interactions between stress-related neurotransmitters that converge on locus coeruleus neurons regulate shifts between these modes of discharge in response to the challenge of a stressor. This review focuses specifically on the locus coeruleus because it is the major source of norepinephrine to the forebrain and has been implicated in behavioral and cognitive aspects of stress responses.",

The release of the counter-regulatory hormones was measured and a symptom questionnaire was filled out every 10 min. The hypoglycemic thresholds (taken as the plasma glucose level where the response exceeded the basal level +2 s.d.) were practically identical in the two groups both for the hormones and the symptoms (including hunger). Our results argue against the hypothesis that an increased sensitivity to a falling plasma glucose is of importance in the pathogenesis of obesity.",

Most forms of type 2 diabetes are polygenic with complex inheritance patterns, and penetrance is strongly influenced by environmental factors. The specific genes involved are not yet known, but impaired glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is an early, genetically determined defect that is present in non-diabetic relatives of diabetic subjects. The rate-limiting step in muscle glucose use is the transmembrane transport of glucose mediated by glucose transporter (GLUT) 4 (ref. 4), which is expressed mainly in skeletal muscle, heart and adipose tissue. GLUT4 mediates glucose transport stimulated by insulin and contraction/exercise. The importance of GLUT4 and glucose uptake in muscle, however, was challenged by two recent observations. Whereas heterozygous GLUT4 knockout mice show moderate glucose intolerance, homozygous whole-body GLUT4 knockout (GLUT4-null) mice have only mild perturbations in glucose homeostasis and have growth retardation, depletion of fat stores, cardiac hypertrophy and failure, and a shortened life span. Moreover, muscle-specific inactivation of the insulin receptor results in minimal, if any, change in glucose tolerance. To determine the importance of glucose uptake into muscle for glucose homeostasis, we disrupted GLUT4 selectively in mouse muscles. A profound reduction in basal glucose transport and near-absence of stimulation by insulin or contraction resulted. These mice showed severe insulin resistance and glucose intolerance from an early age. Thus, GLUT4-mediated glucose transport in muscle is essential to the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis.",
