In the rat liver, fumarase was predominantly located in the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, but not in the peroxisomal fraction. The amount of fumarase associated with the microsomes was less than 5% of the total enzyme activity. The investigation of the intracellular distribution of hepatic fumarase of the rat, mouse, rabbit, dog, chicken, snake, frog, and carp revealed that the amount of the enzyme located in the cytosol was comparable to that in the mitochondria of all these animals. The subcellular distribution of the enzyme in the kidney, brain, heart, and skeletal muscle of rat, and in hepatoma cells (AH-109A) was also investigated. Among these tissues, the brain was the only exception, having no fumarase activity in the cytosolic fraction, and the other tissues showed a bimodal distribution of fumarase in the cytosol and the mitochondria. The mitochondrial fumarase was predominantly located in the matrix. About 10% of the total fumarase was found in the outer and inner membrane, although it was unclear whether this fumarase was originally located in these fractions. No fumarase activity was detected in the intermembranous space.",

There was no change in the maximum percentage of 13C enrichments of the amino acids on depolarization, but the maxima were reached more rapidly, indicating that rates of metabolism in both glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were accelerated. Although labelling of lactate and of citrate approached the theoretical maximum of 50%, labelling of the amino acids was always below 20%, suggesting that there is a metabolic pool or compartment that is inaccessible to exogenous substrates. Under resting conditions labelling of citrate and of glutamine from [1-13C]glucose was not detected, whereas both were labelled from [2-13C]acetate, which is considered to reflect glial metabolism. In contrast, considerable labelling of these two metabolites from [1-13C]glucose was observed in depolarized tissues, suggesting that the increased metabolism may be due to increased consumption of glucose by glial cells. The labelling patterns on depolarization from [1-13C]glucose alone and from both precursors [( 1-13C]glucose plus [2-13C]acetate) were similar, which also indicates that the changes are due to increased consumption of glucose rather than acetate.",

If so, the kinetics of changes in (13)C-glutamate can be used to predict citric acid cycle flux. For this to be a valid assumption, the brain mitochondrial transporters of glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate must operate under physiologic conditions at rates much faster than that of the citric acid cycle. To test the assumption, we incubated brain mitochondria under physiologic conditions, metabolizing both pyruvate and glutamate and measured rates of glutamate, aspartate, and alpha-ketoglutarate transport. Under the conditions employed (66% of maximal O(2) consumption), the rate of synthesis of intramitochondrial alpha-ketoglutarate was 142 nmol/min.mg and the combined initial rate of alpha-ketoglutarate plus glutamate efflux from the mitochondria was 95 nmol/min.mg. It thus seems that much of the alpha-ketoglutarate synthesized within the mitochondria proceeds around the citric acid cycle without equilibrating with cytosolic glutamate. Unless the two pools are in such rapid exchange that they maintain the same percent (13)C enrichment at all points, (13)C enrichment of glutamate alone cannot be used to determine tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. The alpha-ketoglutarate pool is far smaller than the glutamate pool and will therefore approach steady state faster than will glutamate at the metabolite transport rates measured.",

Compared with young subjects, neuronal mitochondrial metabolism and glutamate-glutamine cycle flux was approximately 30% lower in elderly subjects. The reduction in individual subjects correlated strongly with reductions in N-acetylaspartate and glutamate concentrations consistent with chronic reductions in brain mitochondrial function. In elderly subjects infused with [2-(13)C]acetate labeling of glutamine, C4 and C3 differed from that of the young subjects, indicating age-related changes in glial mitochondrial metabolism. Taken together, these studies show that healthy aging is associated with reduced neuronal mitochondrial metabolism and altered glial mitochondrial metabolism, which may in part be responsible for declines in brain function.",

    "abstxt": "Pyruvate carboxylation (PC) is thought to be the major anaplerotic reaction for the tricarboxylic acid cycle and is necessary for de novo synthesis of amino acid neurotransmitters. In the brain, the main enzyme involved is pyruvate carboxylase, which is predominantly located in astrocytes. Carboxylation leads to the formation of oxaloacetate, which condenses with acetyl coenzyme A to form citrate. However, oxaloacetate may also be converted to malate and fumarate before being regenerated. This pathway is termed the oxaloacetate-fumarate-flux or backflux. Carbon isotope-based methods for quantification of activity of PC lead to underestimation when backflux is not taken into account and critical errors have been made in the interpretation of results from metabolic studies. This study was conducted to establish the degree of backflux after PC in cerebellar and neocortical astrocytes. Astrocyte cultures from cerebellum or neocortex were incubated with either [3-(13) C] or [2-(13) C]glucose, and extracts were analyzed using mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Substantial PC compared with pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was observed, and extensive backflux was demonstrated in both types of astrocytes. The extent of backflux varied between the metabolites, reaffirming that metabolism is highly compartmentalized. By applying our calculations to published data, we demonstrate the existence of backflux in vivo in cat, rat, mouse, and human brain. Thus, backflux should be taken into account when calculating the magnitude of PC to allow for a more precise evaluation of cerebral metabolism.",

We review here the functional and molecular identification of the transporters that mediate this transfer. The emerging picture of glutamine transfer in adult brain is of a dominant pathway mediated by system N transport (SN1) in astrocytes and system A transport (SAT/ATA) in neurons. The participating glutamine transporters are functionally and structurally related, sharing the following properties: (a) unlike many neutral amino acid transporters which have proven to be obligate exchangers, these glutamine transporters mediate net substrate transfer energized by coupling to ionic gradients; (b) they are sensitive to small pH changes in the physiological range; (c) they are susceptible to adaptive and humoral regulation; (d) they are related structurally to the AAAP (amino acid and auxin permeases) family of transporters. A key difference between SN1 and the SAT/ATA transporters is the ready reversibility of glutamine fluxes via SN1 under physiological conditions, which allows SN1 both to sustain a glutamine concentration gradient in astrocytes and to mediate the net outward flux of glutamine. It is likely that the ASCT2 transporter, an obligate exchanger of neutral amino acids, displaces the SN1 transporter as the main carrier of glutamine export in proliferating astrocytes.",

    "abstxt": "We provide an integrative interpretation of neuroglial metabolic coupling including the presence of subcellular compartmentation of pyruvate and monocarboxylate recycling through the plasma membrane of both neurons and glial cells. The subcellular compartmentation of pyruvate allows neurons and astrocytes to select between glucose and lactate as alternative substrates, depending on their relative extracellular concentration and the operation of a redox switch. This mechanism is based on the inhibition of glycolysis at the level of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase by NAD(+) limitation, under sufficiently reduced cytosolic NAD(+)/NADH redox conditions. Lactate and pyruvate recycling through the plasma membrane allows the return to the extracellular medium of cytosolic monocarboxylates enabling their transcellular, reversible, exchange between neurons and astrocytes. Together, intracellular pyruvate compartmentation and monocarboxylate recycling result in an effective transcellular coupling between the cytosolic NAD(+)/NADH redox states of both neurons and glial cells. Following glutamatergic neurotransmission, increased glutamate uptake by the astrocytes is proposed to augment glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, balancing to a reduced cytosolic NAD(+)/NADH in the glia. Reducing equivalents are transferred then to the neuron resulting in a reduced neuronal NAD(+)/NADH redox state. This may eventually switch off neuronal glycolysis, favoring the oxidation of extracellular lactate in the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) equilibrium and in the neuronal tricarboxylic acid cycles. Finally, pyruvate derived from neuronal lactate oxidation, may return to the extracellular space and to the astrocyte, restoring the basal redox state and beginning a new loop of the lactate/pyruvate transcellular coupling cycle. Transcellular redox coupling operates through the plasma membrane transporters of monocarboxylates, similarly to the intracellular redox shuttles coupling the cytosolic and mitochondrial redox states through the transporters of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Finally, transcellular redox coupling mechanisms may couple glycolytic and oxidative zones in other heterogeneous tissues including muscle and tumors.",

    "abstxt": "13N-labeled ammonia was used to study the cerebral uptake and metabolism of ammonia in conscious rats. After infusion of physiological concentrations of [13N]ammonia for 10 min via one internal carotid artery, the relative specific activities of glutamate, glutamine (alpha-amino), and glutamine (amide) in brain were approximately 1:5:400, respectively. The data are consistent with the concept that ammonia, entering the brain from the blood, is metabolized in a small pool of glutamate that is both rapidly turning over and distinct from a larger tissue glutamate pool (Berl, S., Takagaki, G., Clarke, D.D., and Waelsch, H. (1962) J. Biol. Chem. 237, 2562-2569). Analysis of 13N-metabolites, after infusion of [13N]ammonia into one lateral cerebral ventricle, indicated that ammonia entering the brain from the cerebrospinal fluid is also metabolized in a small glutamate pool. Pretreatment of rats with methionine sulfoximine led to a decrease in the label present in brain glutamine (amide) following carotid artery infusion of [13N]ammonia. On the other hand, 13N activity in brain glutamate was greater than that in the alpha-amino group of glutamine, i.e. following methionine sulfoximine treatment the expected precursor-product relationship was observed, indicating that the two pools of glutamate in the brain were no longer metabolically distinct. The amount of label recovered in the right cerebral hemisphere, 5 s after a rapid bolus injection of [13N]ammonia via the right common carotid artery, was found to be independent of ammonia concentration within the bolus over a 1000-fold range. This finding indicates that ammonia enters the brain from the blood largely by diffusion. In normal rats that were killed by a freeze-blowing technique 5 s after injection of an [13N]ammonia bolus, approximately 60% of the label recovered in brain had already been incorporated into glutamine, indicating that the t1/2 for conversion of ammonia to glutamine in the small pool is in the range of 1 to 3 s or less. The data emphasize the importance of the small pool glutamine synthetase as a metabolic trap for the detoxification of blood-borne and endogenously produced brain ammonia. The possibility that the astrocytes represent the anatomical site of the small pool is considered.",

CMR(glc) rose during brain activation, and increased activity of the oxidative pathway in working astrocytes during acoustic stimulation was registered with [2-14C]acetate. In contrast, the stimulation-induced increase in metabolic activity was not reflected by greater trapping of products of [1-14C]hydroxybutyrate. The [2-14C]acetate uptake coefficient in the inferior colliculus and lateral lemniscus during acoustic stimulation was 15% and 18% (p &lt; 0.01) higher in the activated compared to contralateral hemisphere, whereas CMR(glc) in these structures rose by 66% (p &lt; 0.01) and 42% (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. Calculated rates of brain utilization of blood-borne acetate (CMR(acetate)) are about 15-25% of total CMR(glc) in non-stimulated tissue and 10-20% of CMR(glc) in acoustically activated structures; they range from 28 to 115% of estimated rates of glucose oxidation in astrocytes. The rise in acetate utilization during acoustic stimulation is modest compared to total CMR(glc), but astrocytic oxidative metabolism of 'minor' substrates present in blood can make a significant contribution to the overall energetics of astrocytes and astrocyte-neuron interactions in working brain.",

Individual (13)C isotopomers (singlets and multiplets observed in (13)C spectra) were quantified automatically using LCModel. The distinct (13)C spectral pattern observed in glutamate and glutamine directly reflected the fact that glucose was metabolized primarily in the neuronal compartment and acetate in the glial compartment. Time courses of concentration of singly and multiply-labeled isotopomers of glutamate and glutamine were obtained with a temporal resolution of 11 min.

Over a wide range of brain lactate concentrations, lactate specific activity was close to the theoretical maximum, i.e. half that of [6-14C]glucose, indicating that exchange-mediated dilution of lactate is negligible and that efflux of [14C]lactate probably accounts for most of the label loss. Low lactate dilution also indicates that dilution of glutamate C4 fractional enrichment in [13C]glucose studies, currently ascribed predominantly to lactate exchange, arises from other unidentified pathways or factors. Alternative explanations for glutamate dilution (presented in Supporting Information) include poorly labeled amino acid pools and oxidative metabolism of minor substrates in astrocytes to first dilute the astrocytic glutamine pool, followed by dilution of glutamate via glutamate-glutamine cycling.",

Although glial glycolysis is thought to largely sustain the energetic requirements of neurotransmission while oxidative metabolism takes place mainly in neurons, this hypothesis is matter of debate. The compartmentalization of cerebral metabolic fluxes can be determined by (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy upon infusion of (13)C-enriched compounds, especially glucose. Rats under light \u03b1-chloralose anesthesia were infused with [1,6-(13)C]glucose and (13)C enrichment in the brain metabolites was measured by (13)C NMR spectroscopy with high sensitivity and spectral resolution at 14.1 T. This allowed determining (13)C enrichment curves of amino acid carbons with high reproducibility and to reliably estimate cerebral metabolic fluxes (mean error of 8%). We further found that TCA cycle intermediates are not required for flux determination in mathematical models of brain metabolism. Neuronal tricarboxylic acid cycle rate (V(TCA)) and neurotransmission rate (V(NT)) were 0.45\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 and 0.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u2009\u03bcmol/g/min, respectively. Glial V(TCA) was found to be 38\u2009\u00b1\u20093% of total cerebral oxidative metabolism, accounting for more than half of neuronal oxidative metabolism. Furthermore, glial anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation rate (V(PC)) was 0.069\u2009\u00b1\u20090.004\u2009\u03bcmol/g/min, i.e., 25\u2009\u00b1\u20091% of the glial TCA cycle rate. These results support a role of glial cells as active partners of neurons during synaptic transmission beyond glycolytic metabolism.",

    "abstxt": "The cytotoxicity of glutamate and several analogues was investigated using a well characterized glutamatergic system; the neuromuscular system of the locust leg. In the presence of Con A (10(-6) M) (which blocks glutamate receptor desensitization) bath application on L-glutamate to isolated nerve-muscle preparations induced degeneration of the muscle cells in a dose-dependent manner. The ability of glutamate analogues to cause similar damage corresponded to their pharmacological potency, i.e. L-quisqualate greater than L-glutamate greater than L-cysteine greater than L-aspartate and L-kainate. Glutamate and the more potent agonists initially caused muscle swelling. This was followed by an increase in opacity of the muscle due to vacuolation resulting from disruption of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca2+-free saline slowed the cytotoxic action of these amino acids, whilst saline containing high concentrations of Ca2+ (20 mM; substituted for Na+) accelerated muscle destruction. Denervation induces supersensitivity of locust muscle to L-glutamate; in denervated muscles the cytotoxicity of L-glutamate was enhanced. Muscles swollen by exposure to high-potassium saline (100 mM; substituted for sodium) were not damaged. We conclude that in this insect glutamatergic system, when desensitization is prevented, activated glutamate receptors gate the influx of Ca2+ and Na2+ causing an ionic imbalance which results in cellular damage. This mechanism could also account for at least some of the neurotoxic effects of amino acids in the vertebrate central nervous system. The results of our studies also indicate that other transmitters which gate non-desensitizing cationic channels should, in principle, also be cytotoxic.",

[2,4,6,8-13C4]octanoate oxidation in intact rats was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We found that oxidation of 13C-octanoate in brain is avid and contributes approximately 20% to total brain oxidative energy production. Labeling patterns of glutamate and glutamine were distinct, and analysis of these metabolites indicated compartmentalized oxidation of octanoate in brain. Examination of liver and blood spectra revealed that label from 13C-octanoate was incorporated into glucose and ketones, which enabled calculation of its overall energy contribution to brain metabolism: glucose (predominantly unlabeled) and 13C-labeled octanoate can account for the entire oxidative metabolism of brain. Additionally, flux through anaplerotic pathways relative to tricarboxylic acid cycle flux (Y) was calculated to be 0.08 +/- 0.039 in brain, indicating that anaplerotic flux is significant and should be considered when assessing brain metabolism. Y was associated with the glutamine synthesis compartment, consistent with the view that anaplerotic flux occurs primarily in astrocytes.",

The use of three-dimensional localization resulted in the complete elimination of triacylglycerol resonance that originated in scalp and subcutaneous fat. The sensitivity and resolution were sufficient to allow 4 min of time-resolved observation of label incorporation into the C3 and C4 resonances of glutamate and C4 of glutamine, as well as C3 of aspartate with lower time resolution. [4-13C]Glutamate labeled rapidly reaching close to maximum labeling at 60 min. The label flow into [3-13C]glutamate clearly lagged behind that of [4-13C]-glutamate and peaked at t = 110-140 min. Multiplets due to homonuclear 13C-13C coupling between the C3 and C4 peaks of the glutamate molecule were observed in vivo. Isotopomer analysis of spectra acquired between 120 and 180 min yielded a 13C isotopic fraction at C4 glutamate of 27 +/- 2% (n = 4), which was slightly less than one-half the enrichment of the C1 position of plasma glucose (63 +/- 1%), p &lt; 0.05. By comparison with an external standard the total amount of [4-13C]glutamate was directly quantified to be 2.4 +/- 0.1 mumol/ml-brain. Together with the isotopomer data this gave a calculated brain glutamate concentration of 9.1 +/- 0.7 mumol/ml, which agrees with previous estimates of total brain glutamate concentrations. The agreement suggests that essentially all of the brain glutamate is derived from glucose in health human brain.",

At rest, oxidative glucose consumption [CMR(Glc(ox))] was 0.41 +/- 0.03 miccromol. g(-1). min(-1), and (glial) pyruvate carboxylation (VPC) was 0.09 +/- 0.02 micromol. g(-1). min(-1). The flux through glutamine synthetase (Vsyn) was 0.26 +/- 0.06 micromol. g(-1). min(-1).

BCAA catabolism involves 2 initial enzymatic steps that are common to all 3 BCAAs; therefore, the dietary intake of an individual BCAA impacts on the catabolism of all 3. The first step is reversible transamination followed by irreversible oxidative decarboxylation of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid transamination products, the branched chain alpha-keto acids (BCKAs). The BCAA catabolic enzymes are distributed widely in body tissues and, with the exception of the nervous system, all reactions occur in the mitochondria of the cell. Transamination provides a mechanism for dispersing BCAA nitrogen according to the tissue's requirements for glutamate and other dispensable amino acids. The intracellular compartmentalization of the branched-chain aminotransferase isozymes (mitochondrial branched-chain aminotransferase, cytosolic branched-chain aminotransferase) impacts on intra- and interorgan exchange of BCAA metabolites, nitrogen cycling, and net nitrogen transfer. BCAAs play an important role in brain neurotransmitter synthesis. Moreover, a dysregulation of the BCAA catabolic pathways that leads to excess BCAAs and their derivatives (e.g., BCKAs) results in neural dysfunction. The relatively low activity of catabolic enzymes in primates relative to the rat may make the human more susceptible to excess BCAA intake. It is hypothesized that the symptoms of excess intake would mimic the neurological symptoms of hereditary diseases of BCAA metabolism.",

Here we describe how studies of brain energy metabolism at Yale, especially with (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy and related techniques, contributed to development of quantitative functional brain imaging with fMRI by providing a reliable measurement of baseline energy. This narrative takes us on a journey, from molecules to mind, with illuminating insights about neuronal-glial activities in relation to energy demand of synaptic activity.

In this study, the contributions of ketone bodies and glucose to cerebral cortical metabolism were measured in vivo in halothane-anesthetized rats fasted for 36 hours (n=6) and receiving intravenous [2,4-(13)C(2)]-D-\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Time courses of (13)C-enriched brain amino acids (glutamate-C4, glutamine-C4, and glutamate and glutamine-C3) were measured at 9.4 Tesla using spatially localized (1)H-[(13)C]-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Metabolic rates were estimated by fitting a constrained, two-compartment (neuron-astrocyte) metabolic model to the (13)C time-course data. We found that ketone body oxidation was substantial, accounting for 40% of total substrate oxidation (glucose plus ketone bodies) by neurons and astrocytes. D-\u03b2-Hydroxybutyrate was oxidized to a greater extent in neurons than in astrocytes (\u2248 70:30), and followed a pattern closely similar to the metabolism of [1-(13)C]glucose reported in previous studies. Total neuronal tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) flux in hyperketonemic rats was similar to values reported for normal (nonketotic) anesthetized rats infused with [1-(13)C]glucose, but neuronal glucose oxidation was 40% to 50% lower, indicating that ketone bodies had compensated for the reduction in glucose use.",

Brain GLU C5 was 13C-enriched by intravenous [2,5-13C]glucose infusion. GLU(ECF) was collected by microdialysis from the cortico-striatal region of awake rats. The 13C-enrichment of basal dialysate GLU C5 during 0.75-1.25 hr of infusion was 0.263 +/- 0.01, very close to the enrichment of whole-brain GLU C5. The result strongly suggests that dialysate GLU consists predominantly of neurotransmitter GLU. For selective 13C-enrichment of neurotransmitter GLU, the whole-brain 13C-enrichment was followed by [12C]glucose infusion to chase 13C from the small glial GLU pool. This leaves [5-13C]GLU mainly in the large neuronal metabolic pool and the vesicular neurotransmitter pool. The uptake of synaptic [5-13C]GLU(ECF) into glia and metabolism to glutamine (GLN) were monitored in vivo by NMR observation of [5-13C,15N]GLN formed during 15NH4Ac infusion. The rate of GLN synthesis, derived from neurotransmitter GLU(ECF) (which provided 80-90% of the substrate) was 6.4 +/- 0.44 micromol/g/hr. Hence, the observed rate represents a reasonable estimate for the rate of glial uptake of GLU(ECF), a process that is crucial for protecting the brain from GLU excitotoxicity.",

After infusion of [1,2-13C2]glucose or [U-13C4]3-hydroxybutyrate into rats, the uptake of the substrates in brain and their metabolism to [1-13C]bicarbonate could be detected with in vivo 13C NMR spectroscopy. At the end of the infusion experiment, methanol/HCl/HClO4 extracts of the brain tissue were further analysed by high resolution 13C NMR spectroscopy. The 13C spin coupling patterns revealed entirely different isotopomer distributions for the closely related cerebral metabolites glutamate, glutamine and 4-aminobutyric acid. A quantitative analysis of the 13C spectra demonstrated (i) the existence of two kinetically distinct pools of glutamate, (ii) a pronounced CO2 fixation via pyruvate carboxylase in the glial cells accounting for as much as 38% of the oxaloacetate synthesis in the glial tricarboxylic acid cycle, (iii) a cerebral pyruvate recycling system contributing maximally 17% of the pyruvate metabolism through the pyruvate dehydrogenase in neurons, and (iv) a predominant production of 4-aminobutyric acid from glutamate synthesized in the neurons. In addition, the labelling pattern of N-acetyl aspartate upon infusion of labelled glucose or 3-hydroxybutyrate provided insight into the synthesis of this compound in mammalian brain. While the acetyl moiety originates from the metabolic equivalent of the C-1-C-2 part of cerebral glutamate, the aspartyl moiety is not in direct contact with the intermediates of glycolysis or of the tricarboxylic acid cycles.",

Glucose flux through the pyruvate carboxylase pathway was quantitated following primed dose constant infusion of D-[U-13C]glucose to young rabbits at a rate of 1 mg/kg body weight per min. We demonstrate, for the first time, that multiplet spectra of three adjacent 13C isotopomer in 1,2,3-13C3 in glutamine and glutamate, which are derived from [1,2,3-13C3]pyruvate, present different isotopomer populations in glutamine in comparison to that in glutamate. This is due to two different metabolic compartments characterized by the presence or absence of glutamine synthetase activity and two different tricarboxylic acid cycles, one preferentially mediated by pyruvate carboxylase and the other by pyruvate dehydrogenase. Our results indicate that the anaplerotic pathway accounts for 34% of glutamine synthesis and only 16% of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid syntheses in metabolic and isotopic steady state conditions. These results support the concept, and provide a quantitative measure, that glutamine and/or tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates are supplied by astrocytes to neurons to replenish the neurotransmitter pool of gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate.",

Both ammonia and BMA inhibited 14CO2 production from [U-14C]- and [1-14C]glutamate by astrocytes and neurons and their effects were partially additive. Acute treatment of astrocytes with ammonia (but not BMA) increased astrocytic glutamine. Acute treatment of astrocytes with ammonia or BMA decreased astrocytic glutamate and aspartate (both are key components of the MAS). Acute treatment of neurons with ammonia decreased neuronal aspartate and glutamine and did not apparently affect the efflux of aspartate from neurons. However, acute BMA treatment of neurons led to decreased neuronal glutamate and glutamine and apparently reduced the efflux of aspartate and glutamine from neurons. The data are consistent with the notion that both ammonia and BMA may inhibit the MAS although BMA may also directly inhibit cellular glutamate uptake. Additionally, these results also suggest that ammonia and BMA exert differential effects on astroglial and neuronal glutamate metabolism.",

However, the study of glial metabolism in humans has been hampered by the lack of noninvasive methods. To specifically measure the contribution of astroglia to brain energy metabolism in humans, we used a novel noninvasive nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic approach. We measured carbon 13 incorporation into brain glutamate and glutamine in eight volunteers during an intravenous infusion of [2-13C] acetate, which has been shown in animal models to be metabolized specifically in astroglia. Mathematical modeling of the three established pathways for neurotransmitter glutamate repletion indicates that the glutamate/glutamine neurotransmitter cycle between astroglia and neurons (0.32 +/- 0.07 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) is the major pathway for neuronal glutamate repletion and that the astroglial TCA cycle flux (0.14 +/- 0.06 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) accounts for approximately 14% of brain oxygen consumption. Up to 30% of the glutamine transferred to the neurons by the cycle may derive from replacement of oxidized glutamate by anaplerosis. The further application of this approach could potentially enlighten the role of astroglia in supporting brain glutamatergic activity and in neurological and psychiatric disease.",

In the carboxylic/amide region of human brain, the primary products of (13)C label incorporation from [2-(13)C]glucose into glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and N-acetylaspartate were detected. Unlike the commonly used alkanyl region where lipid signals spread over a broad frequency range, the carboxylic carbon signal of lipids was found to be confined to a narrow range centered at 172.5 ppm and present no spectral interference in the absence of lipid suppression. Comparison using phantoms shows that stochastic decoupling is far superior to the commonly used WALTZ sequence at very low decoupling power at 3 T. It was found that glutamine C1 and C5 can be decoupled using stochastic decoupling at 2.2 W, although glutamine protons span a frequency range of approximately 700 Hz. Detailed specific absorption rate analysis was also performed using finite difference time domain numerical simulation.",

The utilization of glucose and acetoacetate, the production of lactate, D-3-hydroxybutyrate, and 14CO2, and the incorporation of 14C and of 3H from 3H2O into lipids and lipid fractions were measured. Both cell types used acetoacetate as an energy substrate and as a lipid precursor; lactate was the major product of glucose metabolism. About 60% of the acetoacetate that was utilized by neurons was oxidized to CO2, whereas this was only approximately 20% in the case of cultured astrocytes. This indicates that the rate at which 14C-labeled Krebs cycle intermediates exchange with pools of unlabeled intermediates is much higher in astrocytes than in neurons. Acetoacetate is a better precursor for the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol than glucose, presumably because it can be used directly in the cytosol for these processes; preferential incorporation into cholesterol was not observed in these in vitro systems. We conclude that ketone bodies can be metabolized both by the glial cells and by the neuronal cells of developing mouse brain.",

The standard deviation reflects primarily intersubject variation, since individual uncertainties were low. The rate of alpha-ketoglutarate/glutamate exchange was 57 +/- 26 mumol min-1 g-1 (n = 3), which is much greater than the TCA cycle rate; the high rate indicates that alpha-ketoglutarate and glutamate are in rapid exchange and can be treated as a single combined kinetic pool. The rate of synthesis of glutamine from glutamate was 0.47 mumol min-1 g-1 (n = 4), with 95% confidence limits of 0.139 and 3.094 mumol min-1 g-1; individual uncertainties were biased heavily toward high synthesis rates. From the TCA cycle rate the brain oxygen consumption was estimated to be 2.14 +/- 0.48 mumol min-1 g-1 (5.07 +/- 1.14 ml 100 g-1 min-1; n = 4), and the rate of brain glucose consumption was calculated to be 0.37 +/- 0.08 mumol min-1 g-1 (n = 4).

Different variants of the model were considered depending on the reversibility of the conversion of fumarate into malate and oxaloacetate. The model also included the possibility of orientation-conserved transfer of the four-carbon citric acid cycle intermediates, leading to conversion of succinyl-CoA C1 into either malate C1 or C4. It was used to analyse NMR data from glutamine isotopomers produced by cerebellar astrocytes incubated with [1-13C]glucose. Partial cycling (39%) between oxaloacetate and fumarate was evident from the analysis. Application of the model to glutamate isotopomers from granule cells incubated with [1-13C]glucose [Martin, M.. Portais, J.C.. Labouesse. J., Canioni. P, &amp; Merle, M. (1993) Eur. J.

    "abstxt": "An electron microscopic, double-labelling immunocytochemical procedure was used to assess the level of fixed glutamate and glutamine in different cell profiles in ultrathin sections of rat cerebellar cortex. The procedure was based on sequential immunolabelling with two rabbit antisera, using gold particles of different sizes as markers and formaldehyde vapour as a means to avoid interference between the two incubations. Model sections containing a series of known concentrations of the respective amino acids (aldehyde--fixed to rat brain protein) were incubated together with the tissue material. These revealed a close to linear relationship between gold particle density and antigen concentration throughout the range of biological relevance. The ratio between the density of the two categories of gold particles was calculated for the individual profile types. This ratio showed a 20-fold variation, with the highest glutamate/glutamine ratios obtained for putative excitatory terminals (terminals of parallel fibres in the outer part of the molecular layer, followed by mossy and climbing fibre boutons) and the lowest for glial cells (Bergmann glia, astrocytes in the granule cell layer, and oligodendrocytes). Granule cell bodies and dendrites, and cell bodies and processes of putative GABAergic cells (Purkinje, basket and Golgi cells) displayed intermediate ratios. The ratios corresponded to millimolar ratios (mM fixed glutamate/mM fixed glutamine) ranging from 4.5 to 0.2, tentatively assessed by adjusting for differences in labelling efficiency of the two antigens. Our results show that the compartmentation of glutamate and glutamine, an issue previously addressed mainly in the test tube, can be studied in morphologically intact preparations at a resolution that matches the complexity of CNS tissue. The data indicate that glutamate is effectively converted to glutamine in all categories of glial cells, and that glutamate synthesis prevails in each of the three types of excitatory terminals in the cerebellar cortex. Terminals of putative GABAergic cells form a distinct low glutamate/low glutamine compartment.",

Positron Emission Tomography measurements of glucose and oxygen uptake during sensory stimulation had shown that the incremental glucose utilization is greater than oxygen leading to the suggestion that the energy required for stimulated neuronal activity arises from nonoxidative glucose metabolism. In this study, the authors used spatially localized 1H-observed, 13C-edited NMR spectroscopy during an infusion of [1,6-13C2]glucose to assess the relationship between changes in Vcycle(Glu/Gln) and glucose utilization (CMRglc(ox)N and CMRglc(nonox)) during the intense cortical activity associated with bicuculline-induced seizures. Metabolic fluxes were determined by model-based analysis of the 13C-enrichment time courses of glutamate-C4 and glutamine-C4 (CMRglc(ox)N, Vcycle(Glu/Gln)) and lactate-C3 (CMRglc(nonox)). The exchange rate between alpha-ketoglutarate and glutamate was found to be significantly faster than TCA cycle flux both for control (41 micromol.g(-1).min(-1); 95% CI, 5 to 109 micromol.g(-1).min(-1)) and during seizures (21 micromol.g(-1).min(-1); 95% CI, 4.4 to 51.8 micromol.g(-1).min(-1)). During seizures, total glucose utilization (CMRglc(ox+nonox)) increased substantially (466% between 0 and 6 minutes; 277% between 6 and 55 minutes). Glucose oxidation (CMRglc(ox)N) also increased (214%; from 0.26 +/- 0.02 to 0.57 +/- 0.07 micromol.g(-1).min(-1)) but to a lesser degree, resulting in a large increase in cortical lactate concentration. Vcycle(Glu/Gln) increased 233% (from 0.22 +/- 0.04 to 0.52 +/- 0.07 micromol.g(-1).min(-1)), which was similar to the increase in glucose oxidation. The value of Vcycle(Glu/Gln) and CMRglc(ox)N obtained here lie on the line predicted in a previous study. These results indicate that neuronal glucose oxidation and not total glucose utilization is coupled to the glutamate/glutamine cycle during intense cortical activation.",

    "abstxt": "Glutamate, released at a majority of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system, depolarizes neurons by acting at specific receptors. Its action is terminated by removal from the synaptic cleft mostly via Na(+)-dependent uptake systems located on both neurons and astrocytes. Here we report that glutamate, in addition to its receptor-mediated actions on neuronal excitability, stimulates glycolysis--i.e., glucose utilization and lactate production--in astrocytes. This metabolic action is mediated by activation of a Na(+)-dependent uptake system and not by interaction with receptors. The mechanism involves the Na+/K(+)-ATPase, which is activated by an increase in the intracellular concentration of Na+ cotransported with glutamate by the electrogenic uptake system. Thus, when glutamate is released from active synapses and taken up by astrocytes, the newly identified signaling pathway described here would provide a simple and direct mechanism to tightly couple neuronal activity to glucose utilization. In addition, glutamate-stimulated glycolysis is consistent with data obtained from functional brain imaging studies indicating local nonoxidative glucose utilization during physiological activation.",

Although technically and experimentally challenging, (13)C MRS has already provided important new information on the relationship between neuroenergetics and neuronal function, the energy cost of brain function, the high neuronal activity in the resting brain state and how neuroenergetics and neurotransmitter cycling are altered in neurological and psychiatric disease. In this article, the current state of (13)C MRS as it is applied to the study of neuroenergetics and neurotransmitter cycling in humans is reviewed. The focus is predominantly on recent findings in humans regarding metabolic pathways, applications to clinical research and the technical status of the method. Results from in vivo (13)C MRS studies in animals are discussed from the standpoint of the validation of MRS measurements of neuroenergetics and neurotransmitter cycling, and where they have helped to identify key questions to address in human research. Controversies concerning the relationship between neuroenergetics and neurotransmitter cycling and factors having an impact on the accurate determination of fluxes through mathematical modeling are addressed. We further touch upon different (13)C-labeled substrates used to study brain metabolism, before reviewing a number of human brain diseases investigated using (13)C MRS. Future technological developments are discussed that will help to overcome the limitations of (13)C MRS, with special attention given to recent developments in hyperpolarized (13)C MRS.",

D-[1-13C]Glucose was administered to rats intraperitoneally, and 6, 15, 30, or 45 min later the rats were killed and extracts from the forebrain were prepared for 13C-NMR analysis and amino acid analysis. The absolute amount of 13C present within each carbonatom pool was determined for C-2, C-3, and C-4 of glutamate, glutamine, and GABA, for C-2 and C-3 of aspartate, and for C-3 of lactate. The natural abundance 13C present in extracts from control rats was also determined for each of these compounds and for N-acetylaspartate and taurine. The pattern of labeling within glutamate and GABA indicates that these amino acids were synthesized primarily within compartments in which glucose was metabolized to pyruvate, followed by decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA for entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In contrast, the labeling pattern for glutamine and aspartate indicates that appreciable amounts of these amino acids were synthesized within a compartment in which glucose was metabolized to pyruvate, followed by carboxylation to oxaloacetate. These results are consistent with the concept that pyruvate carboxylase and glutamine synthetase are glia-specific enzymes, and that this partially accounts for the unusual metabolic compartmentation in CNS tissues. The results of our study also support the concept that there are several pools of glutamate, with different metabolic turnover rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

To determine whether a high level of glutamatergic activity is present in human cortex, the rates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glutamine synthesis, and the glutamate/glutamine cycle were determined in the human occipital/parietal lobe at rest. During an infusion of [1-13C]-glucose, in vivo 13C NMR spectra were obtained of the time courses of label incorporation into [4-13C]-glutamate and [4-13C]-glutamine. Using a metabolic model we have validated in the rat, we calculated a total tricarboxylic acid cycle rate of 0.77 +/- 0.07 micromol/min/g (mean +/- SD, n = 6), a glucose oxidation rate of 0.39 +/- 0.04 micromol/min/g, and a glutamate/glutamine cycle rate of 0.32 +/- 0.05 micromol/min/g (mean +/- SD, n = 6). In agreement with studies in rat cerebral cortex, the glutamate/glutamine cycle is a major metabolic flux in the resting human brain with a rate approximately 80% of glucose oxidation.",

However metabolic modeling studies performed in the brain to date have only modeled time courses of total isotopic enrichment at individual carbon positions (positional enrichments), not taking advantage of the additional dynamic (13)C isotopomer information available from fine-structure multiplets in (13)C spectra. Here we introduce a new (13)C metabolic modeling approach using the concept of bonded cumulative isotopomers, or bonded cumomers. The direct relationship between bonded cumomers and (13)C multiplets enables fitting of the dynamic multiplet data. The potential of this new approach is demonstrated using Monte-Carlo simulations with a brain two-compartment neuronal-glial model. The precision of positional and cumomer approaches are compared for two different metabolic models (with and without glutamine dilution) and for different infusion protocols ([1,6-(13)C(2)]glucose, [1,2-(13)C(2)]acetate, and double infusion [1,6-(13)C(2)]glucose\u00a0+\u00a0[1,2-(13)C(2)]acetate). In all cases, the bonded cumomer approach gives better precision than the positional approach. In addition, of the three different infusion protocols considered here, the double infusion protocol combined with dynamic bonded cumomer modeling appears the most robust for precise determination of all fluxes in the model. The concepts and simulations introduced in the present study set the foundation for taking full advantage of the available dynamic (13)C multiplet data in metabolic modeling.",

However, the reliability of such two-compartment metabolic modeling has not been examined thoroughly. This study uses Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the reliability of metabolic modeling of (13)C positional enrichment time courses measured in brain amino acids such as glutamate and glutamine during [1-(13)C]- or [1,6-(13)C(2)]glucose infusion. Results show that the determination of V(NT) is not very precise under experimental conditions typical of in vivo NMR studies, whereas the neuronal TCA cycle rate V(TCA(N)) is determined with a much higher precision. Consistent with these results, simulated (13)C positional enrichment curves for glutamate and glutamine are much more sensitive to the value of V(TCA(N)) than to the value of V(NT). We conclude that the determination of the glutamate-glutamine cycle rate V(NT) using (13)C MRS is relatively unreliable when fitting (13)C positional enrichment curves obtained during [1-(13)C] or [1,6-(13)C(2)]glucose infusion. Further developments are needed to improve the determination of V(NT), for example using additional information from (13)C-(13)C isotopomers and/or using glial specific substrates such as [2-(13)C]acetate.",

In the hyperammonemic animals, blood ammonia levels were raised from control values of approximately 0.05 mM to approximately 0.35 mM by an intravenous ammonium acetate infusion. Once a steady-state of cerebral metabolites was established, a [1-13C]glucose infusion was initiated, and 13C NMR spectra acquired continuously on a 7-tesla spectrometer to monitor 13C labeling of cerebral metabolites. The time courses of glutamate and glutamine C-4 labeling were fitted to a mathematical model to yield TCA cycle rate (V(TCA)) and the flux from glutamate to glutamine through the glutamine synthetase pathway (V(gln)). Under hyperammonemia the value of V(TCA) was 0.57 +/- 0.16 micromol/min per g (mean +/- SD, n = 6) and was not significantly different (unpaired t test; P &gt; 0.10) from that measured in the control animals (0.46 +/- 0.12 micromol/min per g, n = 5). Therefore, the TCA cycle rate was not significantly altered by hyperammonemia. The measured rate of glutamine synthesis under hyperammonemia was 0.43 +/- 0.14 micromol/min per g (mean +/- SD, n = 6), which was significantly higher (unpaired t test; P &lt; 0.01) than that measured in the control group (0.21 +/- 0.04 micromol/ min per g, n = 5). We propose that the majority of the glutamine synthetase flux under normal physiological conditions results from neurotransmitter substrate cycling between neurons and glia. Under hyperammonemia the observed increase in glutamine synthesis is comparable to the expected increase in ammonia transport into the brain and reported measurements of glutamine efflux under such conditions. Thus, under conditions of elevated plasma ammonia an increase in the rate of glutamine synthesis occurs as a means of ammonia detoxification, and this is superimposed on the constant rate of neurotransmitter cycling through glutamine synthetase.",

From these measurements, we calculated the rates of oxidative Glc metabolism and glutamate-neurotransmitter cycling between neurons and astrocytes (a quantitative measure of glutamatergic neuronal activity). By measuring the rates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and Gln synthesis over a range of synaptic activity, we have determined the stoichiometry between oxidative Glc metabolism and glutamate-neurotransmitter cycling in the cortex to be close to 1:1. This finding indicates that the majority of cortical energy production supports functional (synaptic) glutamatergic neuronal activity. Another implication of this result is that brain activation studies, which map cortical oxidative Glc metabolism, provide a quantitative measure of synaptic glutamate release.",

In this work in vivo and in vitro (13)C NMR spectroscopy were used, with a [2-(13)C]glucose or [5-(13)C]glucose infusion, to determine the rates of glutamate/glutamine cycling, de novo glutamine synthesis via anaplerosis, and the neuronal and astrocytic tricarboxylic acid cycles in the rat cerebral cortex. The rate of glutamate/glutamine cycling measured in this study is compared with that determined from re-analysis of (13)C NMR data acquired during a [1-(13)C]glucose infusion. The excellent agreement between these rates supports the hypothesis that glutamate/glutamine cycling is a major metabolic flux ( approximately 0.20 micromol/min/g) in the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats and the predominant pathway of astrocyte/neuron trafficking of neurotransmitter glutamate precursors. Under normoammonemic conditions anaplerosis was found to comprise 19-26% of the total glutamine synthesis, whilst this fraction increased significantly during hyperammonemia ( approximately 32%). These findings indicate that anaplerotic glutamine synthesis is coupled to nitrogen removal from the brain (ammonia detoxification) under hyperammonemic conditions.",

[13C]NMR spectroscopy at 125 MHz was performed on perchloric acid extracts of the cells or on media collected from the cultures. In addition, the [13C/12C] ratios of the amino acids glutamine, glutamate and 4-aminobutyrate (GABA) were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy, showing a larger degree of labeling in GABA than in glutamate and glutamine from glucose. Glutamine and glutamate were predominantly labeled from acetate. A picture of cellular metabolism mainly regarding the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis was obtained. Due to the fact that acetate is not metabolized by neurons to any significant extent, it could be shown that precursors from astrocytes are incorporated into the GABA pool of neurons grown in co-culture with astrocytes. Spectra of media removed from these cultures revealed that likely precursor candidates for GABA were glutamine and citrate. The importance of glutamine is further substantiated by the finding that inhibition of glutamine synthetase, an enzyme present in astrocytes only, significantly decreased the labeling of GABA in co-cultures incubated with 2-[13C]acetate.",

The time dependence of the [4-13C]glutamine/[4-13C]glutamate labeling ratio was significantly different for all three substrates infused (p&lt;0.001) and showed that acetate is primarily utilized by glia and lactate by neurons, whereas glucose is ubiquitous. The ratio of second- to first-turn TCA cycle labeling for glutamine was significantly lower for acetate (30-100 min infusion; p&lt;0.02) and greater for lactate (10-30 min; p&lt;0.02) than for glucose infusions, while the C-2/C-4 glutamate labeling ratio was similar for all the three substrates. This indicated that transfer of [2-13C]acetate-derived [4-13C]glutamine to neurons was preferred to reentry of label into the glial TCA cycle and that the neuronal TCA cycle turnover is significantly faster than that for glia. Fitting parameters of a function representing a pseudo-first-order process to the time dependence of labeling demonstrated that GABA labeling reaches steady state faster with glutamine labeled from [2-13C]acetate than with glutamate labeled from [3-13C]lactate.

We observed that rat cortical astrocytes produce 14CO2 from 0.2 mM [14C]acetate at a rate of 0.43 nmol/min per milligram of protein, 18 times faster than cortical synaptosomes. Subsequent studies examined whether this was attributable to cellular differences in the transport or metabolism of acetate. The activity of acetyl-CoA synthetase, the first enzymatic step in acetate utilization, was greater in synaptosomes than in astrocytes (5.0 and 2.9 nmol/min per milligram of protein), indicating that slower metabolism in synaptosomes cannot be attributed to lack of enzymatic activity. [14C]Acetate uptake in astrocytes is rapid and time-dependent and follows saturation kinetics (Vmax, 498 nmol/min per milligram of protein; Km, 9.3 mM). Uptake is inhibited stereospecifically by L-lactate as well as by pyruvate, fluoroacetate, propionate, and alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CHC). Preloading astrocytes with L-lactate or acetate, but not D-lactate, pyruvate, or glyoxylate, transaccelerates [14C]acetate uptake. Acetate uptake by astrocytes appears to be mediated by a carrier with properties similar to that of monocarboxylate transport. In contrast, studies with synaptosomes provided no evidence for time-dependent, saturable, transaccelerated, or CHC-inhibitable uptake of [14C]acetate. The high rate of transport in astrocytes compared with synaptosomes explains the rapid incorporation of [14C]acetate into brain glutamine over glutamate. These findings provide support for the use of acetate as a marker for glial metabolism and suggest that extracellular acetate in the brain generated from acetylcholine and ethanol metabolism is accumulated first by astrocytes.",

It was shown that contribution to cerebral metabolism from different substrates can be simultaneously measured in vivo.",

After [1-(13) C]ethanol had been administered systemically to rats, (13) C labels were detected in glutamate, glutamine and aspartate in the carboxylic and amide carbon spectral region. (13) C-labeled bicarbonate HCO\u20093- (161.0\u2009ppm) was also detected. Saturating acetaldehyde C1 at 207.0\u2009ppm was found to have no effect on the ethanol C1 (57.7\u2009ppm) signal intensity after extensive signal averaging, providing direct in vivo evidence that direct metabolism of alcohol by brain tissue is minimal. To compare the labeling of brain metabolites by ethanol with labeling by glucose, in vivo time course data were acquired during intravenous co-infusion of [1-(13) C]ethanol and [(13) C(6) ]-D-glucose. In contrast with labeling by [(13) C(6) ]-D-glucose, which produced doublets of carboxylic/amide carbons with a J coupling constant of 51\u2009Hz, the simultaneously detected glutamate and glutamine singlets were labeled by [1-(13) C]ethanol. As (13) C labels originating from ethanol enter the brain after being converted into [1-(13) C]acetate in the liver, and the direct metabolism of ethanol by brain tissue is negligible, it is suggested that orally or intragastrically administered (13) C-labeled ethanol may be used to study brain metabolism and glutamatergic neurotransmission in investigations involving alcohol administration. In vivo (13) C MRS of rat brain following intragastric administration of (13) C-labeled ethanol is demonstrated.",

    "abstxt": "In vivo 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been applied to studying brain metabolic processes by measuring 13C label incorporation into cytosolic pools such as glutamate and aspartate. However, the rate of exchange between mitochondrial alpha-ketoglutarate/oxaloacetate and cytosolic glutamate/aspartate (Vx) extracted from metabolic modeling has been controversial. Because brain fumarase is exclusively located in the mitochondria, and mitochondrial fumarate is connected to cytosolic aspartate through a chain of fast exchange reactions, it is possible to directly measure Vx from the four-carbon side of the tricarboxylic acid cycle by magnetization transfer. In isoflurane-anesthetized adult rat brain, a relayed 13C magnetization transfer effect on cytosolic aspartate C2 at 53.2 ppm was detected after extensive signal averaging with fumarate C2 at 136.1 ppm irradiated using selective radiofrequency pulses. Quantitative analysis using Bloch-McConnell equations and a four-site exchange model found that Vx approximately 13-19 micromol per g per min (&gt;VTCA, the tricarboxylic acid cycle rate) when the longitudinal relaxation time of malate C2 was assumed to be within +/-33% of that of aspartate C2. If Vx approximately VTCA, the isotopic exchange between mitochondria and cytosol would be too slow on the time scale of 13C longitudinal relaxation to cause a detectable magnetization transfer effect.",
