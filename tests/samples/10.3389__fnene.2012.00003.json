    "abstxt": "Brain glycogen levels are dynamically regulated by certain neurotransmitters, including noradrenaline (NA) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). In particular, glycogen synthesis involves activation by NA and VIP of the transcription factors C/EBPbeta and -delta as well as the induction of glycogen synthase. Glycogen accumulation is found in a variety of neuropathological conditions, including reactive astrocytosis after CNS lesions, as well as in Alzheimer's disease. Protein targeting to glycogen (PTG) belongs to a family of proteins that play a key role in glycogen synthesis in peripheral tissues. In this study, we report the presence of PTG mRNA in adult mouse brain, as well as in astrocytes, a non-neuronal cell type that contains most of brain glycogen. Using primary cultures of mouse cortical astrocytes, we observed that NA leads to time- and concentration-dependent induction of PTG mRNA expression. This effect, concomitant to an enhancement of glycogen synthesis in these cells, depends on the activation of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors. Induction of PTG mRNA expression was mimicked by the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin and by dibutyryl cAMP, suggesting the involvement of the cAMP-dependent signal transduction cascade. Among other neuroactive substances known to elevate glycogen levels in astrocytes, VIP had a comparable effect to that of noradrenaline, whereas insulin and glutamate were without effect on PTG mRNA expression. These data suggest that increased PTG expression by neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline and VIP could represent a major event leading to enhancement of glycogen levels in astrocytes.",

Action potentials and postsynaptic effects of glutamate are predicted to consume much of the energy (47% and 34%, respectively), with the resting potential consuming a smaller amount (13%), and glutamate recycling using only 3%. Energy usage depends strongly on action potential rate--an increase in activity of 1 action potential/cortical neuron/s will raise oxygen consumption by 145 mL/100 g grey matter/h. The energy expended on signaling is a large fraction of the total energy used by the brain; this favors the use of energy efficient neural codes and wiring patterns. Our estimates of energy usage predict the use of distributed codes, with &lt;or=15% of neurons simultaneously active, to reduce energy consumption and allow greater computing power from a fixed number of neurons. Functional magnetic resonance imaging signals are likely to be dominated by changes in energy usage associated with synaptic currents and action potential propagation.",

In the present study, the relative significance of glucose and lactate as substrates to maintain neurotransmitter homeostasis was investigated. Cultured cerebellar (primarily glutamatergic) neurons were superfused in medium containing [U-13C]glucose (2.5 mmol/L) and lactate (1 or 5 mmol/L) or glucose (2.5 mmol/L) and [U-13C]lactate (1 mmol/L), and exposed to pulses of N-methyl-D-aspartate (300 micromol/L), leading to synaptic activity including vesicular release. The incorporation of 13C label into intracellular lactate, alanine, succinate, glutamate, and aspartate was determined by mass spectrometry. The metabolism of [U-13C]lactate under non-depolarizing conditions was high compared with that of [U-13C]glucose; however, it decreased significantly during induced depolarization. In contrast, at both concentrations of extracellular lactate, the metabolism of [U-13C]glucose was increased during neuronal depolarization. The role of glucose and lactate as energy substrates during vesicular release as well as transporter-mediated influx and efflux of glutamate was examined using preloaded D-[3H]aspartate as a glutamate tracer and DL-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate to inhibit glutamate transporters. The results suggest that glucose is essential to prevent depolarization-induced reversal of the transporter (efflux), whereas vesicular release was unaffected by the choice of substrate. In conclusion, the present study shows that glucose is a necessary substrate to maintain neurotransmitter homeostasis during synaptic activity and that synaptic activity does not induce an upregulation of lactate metabolism in glutamatergic neurons.",

NMDA (300 microM)-induced release was enhanced (50%) by a simultaneous elevation of the extracellular potassium concentration to 15 mM, which lifts the voltage-dependent magnesium block of the NMDA receptors. This NMDA/K(+)-induced release was not sensitive to DL-TBOA (100 microM) but was inhibited by 75% in the presence of the unspecific calcium channel antagonist La(3+) (100 microM). Glutamate (100 microM) induced a large fractional release of the preloaded [3H]D-aspartate and in the presence of DL-TBOA the release was reduced by approximately 50%. In contrast, release evoked by 25 microM glutamate was not inhibited by DL-TBOA. These results indicate that the release elicited by 100 microM glutamate is comprised of a significant glutamate transporter-mediated component in addition to the vesicular release while the NMDA/K(+)-induced release is vesicular in nature.

Pulses of NMDA at 30, 100, and 300 microM, leading to a progressive increase in both cytosolic [Ca2+] and release of glutamate, increased uptake and metabolism of glucose but not that of lactate as evidenced by mass spectrometric measurement of 13C incorporation into intracellular glutamate.

By varying the glucose isotopomer ([1-13C]glucose or [2-13C]glucose) supplied to the heart, glycogen synthesized at different times during the perfusion was labeled at different carbon sites. Subsequently, the in situ mobilization of glycogen during ischemia was observed by detection of labeled lactate derived from glycolysis of the glucosyl monomers. When [1-13C]glucose was given initially in the perfusion and [2-13C]glucose was given second, [2-13C]lactate was detected first during ischemia and [3-13C]lactate second. This result, and the equivalent result when the glucose labels were given in the reverse order, demonstrates that glycogen synthesis and mobilization are ordered in the heart, where glycogen is found morphologically only as beta particles. Previous studies of glycogen synthesis and mobilization in liver and adipocytes [Devos, P., &amp; Hers, H.-G. (1979) Eur. J. Biochem. 99, 161-167; Devos, P., &amp; Hers, H.-G. (1980) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 95, 1031-1036] have suggested that the organization of beta particles into alpha particles was partially responsible for ordered synthesis and mobilization. The observations reported here for cardiac glycogen suggest that another mechanism is responsible. In addition to examining the ordered synthesis and mobilization of cardiac glycogen, we have selectively monitored the NMR properties of 13C-labeled glycogen synthesized early in the perfusion during further glycogen synthesis from a second, differently labeled substrate. During synthesis from the second labeled glucose monomer, the glycogen resonance from the first label decreased in integrated intensity and increased in line width.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A principal role for brain glycogen as an energy reserve, analogous to its role in the periphery, had been universally dismissed based on its relatively low concentration, an assumption apparently reinforced by the limited duration that the brain can function in the absence of glucose. However, during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia, where brain glucose availability is limited, glycogen content falls first in areas with the highest metabolic rate, suggesting that glycogen provides fuel to support brain function during pathological hypoglycaemia. General anaesthesia results in elevated brain glycogen suggesting quiescent neurones allow glycogen accumulation, and as long ago as the 1950s it was shown that brain glycogen accumulates during sleep, is mobilized upon waking, and that sleep deprivation results in region-specific decreases in brain glycogen, implying a supportive functional role for brain glycogen in the conscious, awake brain. Interest in brain glycogen has recently been re-awakened by the first continuous in vivo measurements using NMR spectroscopy, by the general acceptance of metabolic coupling between glia and neurones involving intercellular transfer of energy substrate, and by studies supporting a prominent physiological role for brain glycogen as a provider of supplemental energy substrate during periods of increased tissue energy demand, when ambient normoglycaemic glucose is unable to meet immediate energy requirements.",

Axon function was assessed as the evoked CAP, and glycogen content was measured biochemically. Isofagomine, a novel inhibitor of central nervous system (CNS) glycogen phosphorylase, significantly increased glycogen content under normoglycemic conditions. When MONs were bathed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing 10 mM glucose, the CAP failed 16 min after exposure to glucose-free aCSF. MONs bathed in aCSF plus isofagomine displayed accelerated CAP failure on glucose removal. Similar results were obtained in MONs bathed in 30 mM glucose, which increased baseline glycogen concentration. The ability of isofagomine to increase glycogen content thus was not translated into delayed CAP failure. This is likely due to the inability of the tissue to metabolize glycogen in the presence of isofagomine, highlighting the importance of glycogen in sustaining neural function during aglycemia. The hypothesis that glycogen breakdown supports intense neural activity was tested by blocking glycogen breakdown during periods of high-frequency stimulation. The CAP area declined more rapidly when glycogen metabolism was inhibited by isofagomine, explicitly showing an important physiological role for glycogen metabolism during neural activity.",

Fine structural analysis of glycogen purified from the liver and skeletal muscle of starved rats suggested that the glycogenolysis included a lysosomal component, in addition to the conventional phosphorolytic pathway. In support of this the hepatic acid alpha-glucosidase activity increased 1.8-fold following starvation. 3. Refeeding resulted in liver glycogen synthesis at a linear rate of 40 mumol/g tissue per hr over the first 13 hr of refeeding. The hepatic glycogen store were replenished by 8 hr of refeeding, but synthesis continued and the hepatic glycogen content peaked at 24 hr (approximately 670 mumol/g tissue). 4. Refeeding resulted in skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis at an initial rate of 40 mumol/g tissue per hr. The muscle glycogen store was replenished by 30 min of refeeding, but synthesis continued and the glycogen content peaked at 13 hr (approximately 50 mumol/g tissue). 5.

Identification of glycogen was obtained by employing osmium tetroxide-potassium ferrocyanide and the periodic acid-thiocarbohydrazide-silver protein technique as ultrastructural contrast stains. A lead-capture method was used to localize G6Pase activity with glucose-6-phosphate or mannose-6-phosphate as substrate. Cerebral G6Pase functions predominantly as a phosphohydrolase to convert glucose-6-phosphate to glucose. Some glucose-6-phosphate in vivo may be derived from the breakdown of glycogen stores. Within the sampled cell types, presumptive glycogen appeared as electron-dense, isodiametric particles scattered throughout the cytoplasm. Reaction product for G6Pase activity was localized consistently within the lumen of the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum and frequently within an outer saccule of the Golgi complex under normal conditions. Choroid plexus epithelia from stressed mice exhibited a qualitative increase in cytoplasmic glycogen and a decrease in G6Pase activity; the other cell types did not express demonstrable alterations in glycogen concentration and G6Pase activity. The results indicate that glycogen and G6Pase activity are prevalent within non-neural cells of the adult mammalian CNS. Glucose utilization in the choroid plexus epithelium may be altered by stressful conditions that influence the functional activity of this cell.",

The subtype specificity of a noradrenaline-stimulated increase in rate of CO(2) formation was identical to that for noradrenaline-induced increase in free intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)), suggesting a causal relationship between these two phenomena. The noradrenaline-induced stimulation of pyruvate decarboxylation was abolished in the presence of 10 mM magnesium chloride in the medium, combined with the omission of calcium, a procedure known to prevent an increased [Ca(2+)] in the cytosol from raising intramitochondrial [Ca(2+)]. Thus, the stimulation of metabolic flux through the reaction catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex appears to result from an increase in intramitochondrial [Ca(2+)] ions in astrocytes.

Three of these enzymes, PP-1, PP-2A, and PP-2B, are members of the same gene family, while PP-2C appears to be distinct. PP-1, PP-2A, and PP-2B are complexed to other subunits in vivo, whereas PP-2C has only been isolated as a monomeric protein. PP-1, PP-2A, and PP-2C have broad and overlapping specificities in vitro, and account for virtually all measurable activity in tissue extracts toward a variety of phosphoproteins that regulate metabolism, muscle contractility, and other processes. Their precise functions in vivo are unknown, although important clues to the physiological roles of PP-1 and PP-2A are provided by the effects of okadaic acid and by the subcellular localization of PP-1. The active forms of PP-1 are largely particulate, and their association with subcellular structures is mediated by &quot;targetting subunits&quot; that direct PP-1 to particular locations, enhance its activity toward certain substrates, and confer important regulatory properties upon it. This concept is best established for the glycogen-bound enzymes in skeletal muscle and liver (PP-1G) and the myofibrillar form (PP-1M) in skeletal muscle. The activities of PP-1 and PP-2B are controlled by the second messengers cyclic AMP and calcium. The activity of PP-2B is dependent on calcium and calmodulin, while PP-1 is controlled in a variety of ways that depend on the form of the enzyme and the tissue. PP-1 can be inhibited by cyclic AMP in a variety of cells through the A-kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 and its isoforms. Phosphorylation of the glycogen-binding subunit of PP-1G by A-kinase promotes translocation of the catalytic subunit from glycogen particles to cytosol in skeletal muscle, inhibiting the dephosphorylation of glycogen-metabolizing enzymes. Allosteric inhibition of hepatic PP-1G by phosphorylase a occurs in response to signals that elevate cyclic AMP or calcium, and prevents the activation of glycogen synthase in liver. PP-1 can also be activated indirectly by calcium through the ability of PP-2B to dephosphorylate inhibitor-1. This control mechanism may operate in dopaminoceptive neurones of the brain and other cells. The inactive cytosolic form of PP-1 (PP-1I) can be activated in vitro through the glycogen synthase kinase-3-catalyzed phosphorylation of its inhibitory subunit (inhibitor-2), but the physiological significance is unclear.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

To identify the structural determinants involved, six enzyme forms, including four chimeric enzymes containing exchanges in amino acid residues 1-88, 89-499, and 500-842 (C terminus), were constructed from rabbit muscle and human brain phosphorylase cDNAs, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified. Kinetic analysis of the b forms indicated that the brain isozyme amino acid 1-88 and 89-499 regions each contribute in an additive fashion to the formation of an AMP site with higher intrinsic affinity but weakened cooperativity, while the same regions of the muscle isozyme each contribute to greater allosteric coupling but weaker AMP affinity. Kinetic analysis of the a forms indicated that the amino acid 89-499 region correlated with the reduced response of the brain isozyme to activation by phosphorylation and the resultant increased sensitivity of the a form to activation by saturating levels of AMP. This isozyme-specific response also correlated with the glycogen affinity of the a forms. Enzymes containing the brain isozyme amino acid 89-499 region exhibited markedly reduced glycogen affinities in the absence of AMP compared to enzymes containing the corresponding muscle isozyme region. Additionally, AMP led to greater increases in glycogen affinity of the former set of enzymes. In contrast, phosphate affinities of all a forms were similar in the absence of AMP and increased approximately the same extent in AMP. The potential importance of a number of isozyme-specific substitutions in these sequence regions is discussed.",

The rats were anaesthetized 4h later and glycogenolysis was induced by giving them a mixture of glucagon and insulin. In confirmation of previous work [Devos &amp; Hers (1979) Eur J. Biochem. 99, 161-167],, there was a delay in degradation of the labelled glycogen by comparison with total glycogen. This pattern is considered as characteristic of an ordered glycogenolysis. Treatment of rats with phlorizin abolished the difference between the fate of labelled and total glycogen, causing, therefore, a random glycogenolysis. 2. Foetal liver glycogen was made radioactive by injecting [14C] glucose into the mother at the 19.5 day of gestation, i.e. at the time when this glycogen starts to be synthesized. During the postnatal degradation of this glycogen, radioactive and total glycogen were degraded at approximately the same rate, indicating that glycogenolysis occurred at random. In contrast, when puromycin was injected into the newborn rats, there was a delay in he degradation of the labelled glycogen as compared with that of total glycogen, as currently observed in the normal adult liver. 3. These data are discussed in relation with the fact that glycogen-filled vacuoles are currently seen in the livers of adult rats treated with phlorizin, and also in the neonatal livers, and that puromycin is known to cause the disappearance of these autophagic pictures in the liver of newborn rats. It is suggested that random glycogenolysis occurs through hydrolysis by the lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase, in the course of autophagy.",

Current models for lactate transport and metabolism involving cellular responses to excitatory neurotransmission are highly debated, owing, in part, to discordant results obtained in different experimental systems and conditions. Major conclusions drawn from tabular data summarizing results obtained in many laboratories are as follows: Glutamate-stimulated glycolysis is not an inherent property of all astrocyte cultures. Synaptosomes from the adult brain and many preparations of cultured neurons have high capacities to increase glucose transport, glycolysis, and glucose-supported respiration, and pathway rates are stimulated by glutamate and compounds that enhance metabolic demand. Lactate accumulation in activated tissue is a minor fraction of glucose metabolized and does not reflect pathway fluxes. Brain activation in subjects with low plasma lactate causes outward, brain-to-blood lactate gradients, and lactate is quickly released in substantial amounts. Lactate utilization by the adult brain increases during lactate infusions and strenuous exercise that markedly increase blood lactate levels. Lactate can be an 'opportunistic', glucose-sparing substrate when present in high amounts, but most evidence supports glucose as the major fuel for normal, activated brain.",

In the present study, glycogen utilization in brain of normal conscious rats during sensory stimulation was assessed by three approaches, change in concentration, release of (14)C from pre-labeled glycogen and compensatory increase in utilization of blood glucose (CMR(glc)) evoked by treatment with a glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor. Glycogen level fell in cortex, (14)C release increased in three structures and inhibitor treatment caused regionally selective compensatory increases in CMR(glc) over and above the activation-induced rise in vehicle-treated rats. The compensatory rise in CMR(glc) was highest in sensory-parietal cortex where it corresponded to about half of the stimulus-induced rise in CMR(glcf) in vehicle-treated rats; this response did not correlate with metabolic rate, stimulus-induced rise in CMR(glc) or sequential station in sensory pathway. Thus, glycogen is an active fuel for specific structures in normal activated brain, not simply an emergency fuel depot and flux-generated pyruvate greatly exceeded net accumulation of lactate or net consumption of glycogen during activation. The metabolic fate of glycogen is unknown, but adding glycogen to the fuel consumed during activation would contribute to a fall in CMR(O2)/CMR(glc) ratio.",

We found that glycogen synthesis and degradation affects the relative amount of glucose taken up by neurons versus astrocytes. Under conditions of 175:115\u2009mmol/L (\u223c1.5:1) neuronal versus astrocytic activation-induced Na(+) influx ratio, \u223c12% of astrocytic glycogen is mobilized. This results in the rapid increase of intracellular glucose-6-phosphate level on stimulation and nearly 40% mean decrease of glucose flow through hexokinase (HK) in astrocytes via product inhibition. The suppression of astrocytic glucose phosphorylation, in turn, favors the channeling of glucose from interstitium to nearby activated neurons, without a critical effect on the concurrent intercellular lactate trafficking. Under conditions of increased neuronal versus astrocytic activation-induced Na(+) influx ratio to 190:65\u2009mmol/L (\u223c3:1), glycogen is not significantly degraded and blood glucose is primarily taken up by neurons. These results support a role for astrocytic glycogen in preserving extracellular glucose for neuronal utilization, rather than providing lactate to neurons as is commonly accepted by the current 'thinking paradigm'. This might be critical in subcellular domains during functional conditions associated with fast energetic demands.",

This mechanism would favor glucose channeling to activated neurons, supplementing the already rich neuron-astrocyte metabolic and functional partnership with important implications for the energy compounds used to sustain neuronal activity. The hypothesis is based on recent modeling evidence suggesting that rapid glycogen breakdown can profoundly alter the short-term kinetics of glucose delivery to neurons and astrocytes. It is also based on review of the literature relevant to glycogen metabolism during physiological brain activity, with an emphasis on the metabolic pathways identifying both the origin and the fate of this glucose reserve.",

On glucose deprivation astroglial cells rapidly deplete their glycogen. In contrast to the situation with hepatocytes, only lactate, but not glucose, is detectable in the medium surrounding the astroglial cells. Besides glucose, astroglial cultures can also use mannose as a substrate for the synthesis of glycogen and the generation of lactate. Although mannose-fed astroglial cells contain glucose-6-phosphate, they do not release a measurable amount of glucose into the culture medium. Instead of glucose the astroglial cells release high amounts of lactate into the culture medium. Gluconolactone or 2-deoxyglucose which prevent glycogen breakdown in astroglial cells after glucose deprivation, allow to discriminate between lactate generated from glycogen and lactate from other sources. The amount of lactate found in the medium in the absence of gluconolactone (or 2-deoxyglucose) exceeds the amount found in the presence of either compound by the lactate equivalents calculated to be contained in the cellular glycogen. In conclusion, glycogen in astrocytes can be considered as a store for lactate rather than for glucose.",

Basal glycogen stores were minimized by fasting and were subsequently replenished in two intervals, the first (0-0.5 h) with tritium-labeled and the second (0.5-3 h) with carbon-labeled glucose as precursor. Glycogen degradation was initiated by addition of forskolin. The kinetics of glycogen accumulation as well as degradation could be approximated by monoexponential equations with rate constants of 0.81 and 1.39 h(-1), respectively. The degradation of glycogen largely followed the last-in-first-out principle, particularly in the initial period. Analysis of the size of the glycogen molecules and the beta-dextrin limit during glycogen accumulation and degradation showed that both synthesis and degradation of glycogen molecules are largely sequential and the small deviation from this order is most pronounced at the beginning of the accumulation and at the end of the degradation period. This pattern may reflect the number of synthase and phosphorylase molecules and fits well with the role of glycogen in skeletal muscle as a readily available energy store and with the known structure of the glycogen molecule. It is emphasized that the observed nonlinear relation between the change in glycogen concentration and release of label during glycogen degradation may have important practical consequences for interpretation of experimental data.",

    "abstxt": "Traditionally, glycogen synthase (GS) has been considered to catalyze the key step of glycogen synthesis and to exercise most of the control over this metabolic pathway. However, recent advances have shown that other factors must be considered. Moreover, the control of glycogen deposition does not follow identical mechanisms in muscle and liver. Glucose must be phosphorylated to promote activation of GS. Glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) binds to GS, causing the allosteric activation of the enzyme probably through a conformational rearrangement that simultaneously converts it into a better substrate for protein phosphatases, which can then lead to the covalent activation of GS. The potency of Glc-6-P for activation of liver GS is determined by its source, since Glc-6-P arising from the catalytic action of glucokinase (GK) is much more effective in mediating the activation of the enzyme than the same metabolite produced by hexokinase I (HK I). As a result, hepatic glycogen deposition from glucose is subject to a system of control in which the 'controller', GS, is in turn controlled by GK. In contrast, in skeletal muscle, the control of glycogen synthesis is shared between glucose transport and GS. The characteristics of the two pairs of isoenzymes, liver GS/GK and muscle GS/HK I, and the relationships that they establish are tailored to suit specific metabolic roles of the tissues in which they are expressed. The key enzymes in glycogen metabolism change their intracellular localization in response to glucose. The changes in the intracellular distribution of liver GS and GK triggered by glucose correlate with stimulation of glycogen synthesis. The translocation of GS, which constitutes an additional mechanism of control, causes the orderly deposition of hepatic glycogen and probably represents a functional advantage in the metabolism of the polysaccharide.",

LD is characterised by the presence of intracellular polyglucosan inclusions, called Lafora bodies, in tissues including the brain, liver and skin. Patients have progressive neurologic deterioration, leading to death within 10 years of onset. No preventive or curative treatment is available for LD. At least three genes underlie LD, of which two have been isolated and mutations characterised: EPM2A and NHLRC1. The EPM2A gene product laforin is a protein phosphatase while the NHLRC1 gene product malin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates and promotes the degradation of laforin. Analyses of the structure and function of these gene products suggest defects in post-translational modification of proteins as the common mechanism that leads to the formation of Lafora inclusion bodies, neurodegeneration and the epileptic phenotype of LD. In this review, we summarise the available information on the genetic basis of LD, and correlate these advances with the rapidly expanding information about the mechanisms of LD gained from studies on both cell biological and animal models. Finally, we also discuss a possible mechanism to explain the locus heterogeneity observed in LD.",

Our previous studies indicated that incubation of isolated hepatocytes with glucose activated GS and resulted in its translocation from a homogeneous cytosolic distribution to the cell periphery. These studies also suggested a relationship with insoluble elements of the cytoskeleton, in particular actin. Here we show the translocation of GS in a different experimental model that allows the analysis of this phenomenon in long-term studies. We describe the reversibility of translocation of GS and its effect on glycogen distribution. Incubation of cultured rat hepatocytes with glucose activated GS and triggered its translocation to the hepatocyte periphery. The relative amount of the enzyme concentrated near the plasma membrane increased with time up to 8 h of incubation with glucose, when the glycogen stores reached their maximal value. The lithium-induced covalent activation of GS was not sufficient to cause its translocation to the cell periphery. The intracellular distribution of GS closely resembled that of glycogen. Our results showed an interaction between GS and an insoluble element of the hepatocyte matrix. Although no co-localization between actin filaments and GS was observed in any condition, disruption of actin cytoskeleton resulted in a significantly lower percentage of cells in which the enzyme translocated to the cell periphery in response to glucose. This observation suggests that the microfilament network has a role in the translocation of GS.",

    "abstxt": "Glycolysis and glycogenolysis are involved in memory processing in day-old chickens and, aside from the provision of energy for neuronal and astrocytic energy metabolism these pathways enable astrocytes to supply neurones with precursor for transmitter glutamate by glucose-based de novo synthesis. We have previously shown that memory processing for bead discrimination learning is dependent on glycolysis; however, the metabolic inhibitor used, iodoacetate, inhibits pyruvate formation from both glucose and glycogen. At specific time points after training transient reductions in brain glycogen content occur, mirrored by increases in glutamate/glutamine content. In the present study, we used intracerebral injection of a glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor, 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol (DAB), which does not affect glucose breakdown, to evaluate the role of glycogen metabolism in memory consolidation. Dose-dependent inhibition of learning occurred when DAB was administered at specific time periods in relation to training: (i) 5 min before training, (ii) around 30 min posttraining, and (iii) 55 min posttraining. After injection at either of the two earlier periods, memory disappeared after consolidation 30 min postlearning, and after injection 55 min after learning memory was absent at 70 min. The memory loss caused by early administration could be prevented after training by central injection of the glutamate precursor glutamine or the astrocyte-specific substrate acetate together with aspartate, substituting for pyruvate carboxylation. Thus, glycogenolysis is essential for learning in this paradigm and, aside from energy supply considerations, we suggest that an important role for glycogenolysis is to provide neurones with glutamine as the precursor for neuronal glutamate and GABA.",

It also reduces the contents of glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate in the right hemisphere. Behavioral evidence supports the conclusion that glucose breakdown serves to provide energy, whereas glycogen acts as a substrate for glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate formation, requiring both pyruvate dehydrogenation to acetyl coenzyme A and pyruvate carboxylation in astrocytes. Inhibition of memory consolidation caused by DAB or 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), an inhibitor of glucose phosphorylation without effect on glycogen metabolism, was challenged by intracerebral administration of acetate, aspartate, glutamine, lactate or glucose. DAB-mediated memory inhibition was successfully challenged by administration at 0 or 20 min posttraining of acetate (an astrocyte-specific acetyl CoA precursor) together with aspartate, substituting for pyruvate carboxylation, or of glutamine at 0-2.5 or 30 min posttraining. 2-DG-mediated memory impairment was not challenged by acetate with or without aspartate at 0 time but was challenged by acetate without aspartate at 20 min. Lactate, a substrate for both dehydrogenation and pyruvate carboxylation challenged both DAB and 2-DG.

The stores in muscle are not homogeneous and there appear to be various metabolic pools. Each granule is capable of independent regulation and fundamental aspects of the regulation appear to be associated with a complex set of proteins (some are enzymes and others serve scaffolding roles) that associate both with the granule and with each other in a dynamic fashion. The regulation includes altered phosphorylation status and often translocation as well. The understanding of the roles and the regulation of glycogenin, protein phosphatase 1, glycogen targeting proteins, laforin and malin are in their infancy. These various processes appear to be the mechanisms that give the glycogen granule precise, yet dynamic regulation.",

During the 150 years since its identification, researchers in the field of glycogen metabolism have made numerous discoveries that are now recognized as significant milestones in biochemistry and cell signaling. Even so, more questions remain, and studies continue to demonstrate the complexity of the regulation of glycogen metabolism. Under classical definitions, the functions of glycogen seem clear: muscle glycogen is degraded to generate ATP during increased energy demand, whereas hepatic glycogen is broken down for release of glucose into the bloodstream to supply other tissues. However, recent findings demonstrate that the roles of glycogen metabolism in energy sensing, integration of metabolic pathways, and coordination of cellular responses to hormonal stimuli are far more complex.",

Although the precise role of brain glycogen to date is unknown, it seems affected by focal activation, neurotransmitters, and overall electrical activity and hormones. Based on its relatively low concentration, the role of brain glycogen as a significant energy store has been discounted. This work reviews recent experimental evidence that brain glycogen is an important reserve of glucose equivalents: (1) glial glycogen can provide the majority of the glucose supply deficit during hypoglycemia for more than 100 min, consistent with the proposal that glial lactate is a fuel for neurons; (2) glycogen concentrations may be as high as 10 micromol/g, substantially higher than was thought previously; (3) glucose cycling in and out of glycogen amounts to approximately 1% of the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc) in human and rat brain, amounting to an effective stability of glycogen in the resting awake brain during euglycemia and hyperglycemia, (4) brain glycogen metabolism/concentrations are insulin/glucose sensitive; and (5) after a single episode of hypoglycemia, brain glycogen levels rebound to levels that exceed the pre-hypoglycemic concentrations (supercompensation). This experimental evidence supports the proposal that brain glycogen may be involved in the development of diabetes complications, specifically impaired glucose sensing (hypoglycemia unawareness) observed clinically in some diabetes patients under insulin treatment. It is proposed further that brain glycogen becomes important in any metabolic state where supply transiently cannot meet demand, such conditions that could occur during prolonged focal activation, sleep deprivation, seizures, and mild hypoxia.",

These abnormalities were exhibited as decreased mitochondrial reducing equivalent flow. One possible cause of this would be the decreased availability of oxidative metabolic substrates in the NE-depleted cortex. We therefore investigated the effect of unilateral LC lesion and the resultant depletion of ipsilateral endogenous NE on glycogen and other energy metabolites in the cerebral cortex of rats under three conditions: (1) at &quot;rest,&quot; (2) when energy demand is inncreased markedly by seizures, and (3) during total cerebral ischemia. We report no differences in cerebral metabolites between NE-depleted and control hemispheres at &quot;rest.&quot; In seizures and ischemia, however, the increase in the level of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and the breakdown of glycogen were impaired considerably in the NE-depleted cortex. The data suggest that depletion of central NE impairs cerebral glycogenolysis in response to increased energy demands and ischemia. Such impairment may be mediated via a cyclic AMP-related mechanism.",

All these isoforms are generated by alternative RNA splicing. The alpha subunit sequence obtained from slow skeletal muscle (soleus) is characterized by an internal deletion of 59 amino acids. This deletion is predominant in mRNA from slow muscle, heart, and uterus and accounts for the smaller alpha subunit variant (alpha') characteristic of phosphorylase kinase purified from slow muscle and heart. The beta subunit mRNA can be differentially spliced at two sites. In all tissues (except skeletal muscle) that were analyzed, an internal segment encoding 28 amino acids of the muscle sequence is replaced by a homologous sequence of identical length, presumably through the use of mutually exclusive exons. In brain and some other tissues, the deduced N-terminal sequence of the beta subunit is also changed. This is achieved by an insertion into the mRNA sequence that interrupts the initial reading frame after 25 codons and starts a new reading frame, encoding a different N terminus of 18 amino acids. This modification probably affects the major regulatory phosphorylation site of the beta subunit.",

In the present communication, mRNA expression of alpha(1)-, alpha(2)- and beta-adrenergic receptors and their subtypes was determined in freshly isolated, cell marker-defined populations of astrocytes, NG2-positive cells, microglia, endothelial cells, and Thy1-positive neurons (mainly glutamatergic projection neurons) in murine cerebral cortex. Immediately after dissection of frontal, parietal and occipital cortex of 10-12-week-old transgenic mice, which combined each cell-type marker with a specific fluorescent signal, the tissue was digested, triturated and centrifuged, yielding a solution of dissociated cells of all types, which were separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). mRNA expression in each cell fraction was determined by microarray analysis. alpha(1A)-Receptors were unequivocally expressed in astrocytes and NG2-positive cells, but absent in other cell types, and alpha(1B)-receptors were not expressed in any cell population. Among alpha(2)-receptors only alpha(2A)-receptors were expressed, unequivocally in astrocytes and NG-positive cells, tentatively in microglia and questionably in Thy1-positive neurons and endothelial cells. beta(1)-Receptors were unequivocally expressed in astrocytes, tentatively in microglia, and questionably in neurons and endothelial cells, whereas beta(2)-adrenergic receptors showed tentative expression in neurons and astrocytes and unequivocal expression in other cell types. This distribution was supported by immunochemical data and its relevance established by previous studies in well-differentiated primary cultures of mouse astrocytes, showing that stimulation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors increases glycogen formation and oxidative metabolism, the latter by a mechanism depending on intramitochondrial Ca(2+), whereas alpha(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation enhances glutamate uptake, and beta-adrenoceptor activation causes glycogenolysis and increased Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity. The Ca(2+)- and cAMP-mediated association between energy-consuming and energy-yielding processes is emphasized.",

Astrocytes derive energy from glycolytic and oxidative pathways, but respiration, with its high-energy yield, provides most adenosine 5' triphosphate (ATP). The proportion of cortical oxidative metabolism attributed to astrocytes ( approximately 30%) in in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic and autoradiographic studies corresponds to their volume fraction, indicating similar oxidation rates in astrocytes and neurons. Astrocyte-selective expression of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) enables synthesis of glutamate from glucose, accounting for two-thirds of astrocytic glucose degradation via combined pyruvate carboxylation and dehydrogenation. Together, glutamate synthesis and oxidation, including neurotransmitter turnover, generate almost as much energy as direct glucose oxidation. Glycolysis and glycogenolysis are essential for astrocytic responses to increasing energy demand because astrocytic filopodial and lamellipodial extensions, which account for 80% of their surface area, are too narrow to accommodate mitochondria; these processes depend on glycolysis, glycogenolysis, and probably diffusion of ATP and phosphocreatine formed via mitochondrial metabolism to satisfy their energy demands. High glycogen turnover in astrocytic processes may stimulate glucose demand and lactate production because less ATP is generated when glucose is metabolized via glycogen, thereby contributing to the decreased oxygen to glucose utilization ratio during brain activation. Generated lactate can spread from activated astrocytes via low-affinity monocarboxylate transporters and gap junctions, but its subsequent fate is unknown. Astrocytic metabolic compartmentation arises from their complex ultrastructure; astrocytes have high oxidative rates plus dependence on glycolysis and glycogenolysis, and their energetics is underestimated if based solely on glutamate cycling.",

Earlier studies of memory consolidation in chicks indicated that beta3-ARs enhanced memory by increasing glucose uptake, whereas beta2-ARs enhance memory by increasing glycogenolysis. This study examines the ability of beta-ARs to increase glucose uptake in chick forebrain astrocytes. The beta-AR agonist isoprenaline increased glucose uptake in a concentration-dependent manner, as did insulin. Glucose uptake was increased by the beta2-AR agonist zinterol and the beta3-AR agonist CL316243, but not by the beta1-AR agonist RO363. In chick astrocytes, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction studies showed that beta1-, beta2-, and beta3-AR mRNA were present, whereas radioligand-binding studies showed the presence of only beta2- and beta3-ARs. beta-AR or insulin-mediated glucose uptake was inhibited by phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and protein kinase C inhibitors, suggesting a possible interaction between the beta-AR and insulin pathways. However beta2- and beta3-ARs increase glucose uptake by two different mechanisms: beta2-ARs via a Gs-cAMP-protein kinase A-dependent pathway, while beta3-ARs via interactions with Gi. These results indicate that activation of beta2- and beta3-ARs causes glucose uptake in chick astrocytes by distinct mechanisms, which may be relevant for memory enhancement.",

We demonstrate that the glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (3-PGK) are enriched in synaptic vesicles, forming a functional complex, and that synaptic vesicles are capable of accumulating the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate by harnessing ATP produced by vesicle-bound GAPDH/3-PGK at the expense of their substrates. The GAPDH inhibitor iodoacetate suppressed GAPDH/3-PGK-dependent, but not exogenous ATP-dependent, [(3)H]glutamate uptake into isolated synaptic vesicles. It also decreased vesicular [(3)H]glutamate content in the nerve ending preparation synaptosome; this decrease was reflected in reduction of depolarization-induced [(3)H]glutamate release. In contrast, oligomycin, a mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor, had minimal effect on any of these parameters. ADP at concentrations above 0.1 mm inhibited vesicular glutamate and dissipated membrane potential. This suggests that the coupled GAPDH/3-PGK system, which converts ADP to ATP, ensures maximal glutamate accumulation into presynaptic vesicles. Together, these observations provide insight into the essential nature of glycolysis in sustaining normal synaptic transmission.",

Isolated synaptic vesicles incorporated [(3)H]glutamate in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ADP. Pyruvate kinase activators and inhibitors stimulated and reduced PEP/ADP-dependent glutamate uptake, respectively. Membrane potential was also formed in the presence of pyruvate kinase activators. &quot;ATP-trapping&quot; experiments using hexokinase and glucose suggest that ATP produced by vesicle-associated pyruvate kinase is more readily used than exogenously added ATP.

Clonidine (partial agonist) increased beta(2)-AR-stimulated cAMP production in alpha(2A/D)-AR-ACII transfectants but inhibited it in alpha(2B)-AR-ACII transfectants. In contrast, epinephrine (full agonist) enhanced beta(2)-stimulated ACII in both alpha(2A)- and alpha(2B)-ACII clonal cell lines. 4-Azidoanilido-[alpha-(32)P]GTP-labeling of activated G proteins indicated that, in alpha(2B)-AR transfectants, clonidine activated only Gi(2), whereas epinephrine, the full agonist, effectively coupled to Gi(2) and Gi(3). Thus, partial and full agonists selectively activate G proteins that lead to drug specific effects on effectors. Moreover, these data indicate that Gi(3) activation is required for potentiation of beta(2)-AR stimulation of AC by alpha(2A/D) and alpha(2B)-AR in DDT1-MF2 cells. This may reflect an issue of the amount of Gbetagamma released upon receptor activation and/or betagamma composition of Gi(3) versus Gi(2).",

We now report that this substance, to which we give the name proglycogen, is a glycogen-like molecule constituting about 15% of total glycogen. It acts as a very efficient acceptor of glucose residues added from UDPglucose. Further, that the endogenous enzyme that adds the glucose to proglycogen is not the autocatalytic protein but a glycogen synthase-like enzyme. Proglycogen may be an intermediate in the synthesis and degradation of macromolecular glycogen and may exist and be metabolized as a separate entity. Consideration should now be given to the revival of the concept that tissue contains two forms of glycogen. One is proglycogen. The other is the 'classical', macromolecular glycogen. Additionally, proglycogen and glycogen may be glucosylated by different forms of synthase.",

In this Review, we discuss the main features of McArdle disease, with the aim of providing neurologists with up-to-date, useful information to assist their patients. The topics covered include diagnostic tools-for example, molecular genetic diagnosis, the classic ischemic forearm test and the so-called 'second wind' phenomenon-and current therapeutic options-for example, a carbohydrate-rich diet and carbohydrate ingestion shortly before strenuous exercise, in combination with medically supervised aerobic training of low to moderate intensity.",

We employed a transmission electron microscopic technique to quantify subcellular G particle size, number, and location in human vastus lateralis biopsies of 11 resting men. The intra- and interobserver variability for the various measures was generally &lt;4%. Granule size and number were quantified in subcellular compartments (subsarcolemmal, intra- and intermyofibrillar). Subcellular location was critical: G was more densely concentrated in the subsarcolemmal than in the myofibrillar space, whereas the single-particle volume was greater in the latter. Single-particle diameter ranged from 10 to 44 etam and followed a continuous, normal distribution. This implies that proglycogen is not a distinct entity, but rather that pro- and macroglycogen are divisions of smaller and larger molecules. These results demonstrate a compartmentalized pattern of subcellular G deposition in human skeletal muscle for both the size and density of granules.",

Five men performed prolonged exercise and had muscle biopsies taken at 0, 4, 24 and 48 h of recovery. We quantified granule number and size as well as the total volume of glycogen in the subsarcolemmal and the intra- and intermyofibrillar regions, using transmission electron microscopy. Muscle glycogen was reduced to 36 +/- 8.3 mmol glucosyl units (kg dry weight)(-1) at exhaustion, and was preferentially depleted and subsequently repleted in the intramyofibrillar space. The repletion rate was greatest in the first 4 h; this was associated with a 186% increase in number (P &lt; or = 0.05) and no change in particle size (P &gt; or = 0.05).

Conversely, the net rate of single-particle volume synthesis was greater (P &lt; or = 0.05) in the myofibrillar than the subsarcolemmal compartment.

We have studied the optimization of these variables by means of a mathematical model of the glycogen molecule. Our results demonstrate that the structure is optimized to maximize (a) the total glucose stored in the smallest possible volume, (b) the proportion of it that can be directly released by phosphorylase before any debranching occurs, and (c) the number of non-reducing ends (points of attack for phosphorylase), which maximizes the speed of fuel release. The optimization of these four variables is achieved with appropriate values for two key parameters in glycogen design: the degree of branching and the length of the chains. The optimal values of these two parameters are precisely those found in cellular glycogen.",

Blot-hybridization analysis reveals that this message is preferentially expressed in human brain, but is also found at a low level in human fetal liver and adult liver and muscle tissues. Although previous studies have suggested that the major isozyme of phosphorylase found in all fetal tissues is the brain type, our data show that the predominant mRNA in fetal liver (24-week gestation) is the adult liver form. The protein sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the brain phosphorylase cDNA is 862 amino acids long compared with 846 and 841 amino acids for the liver and muscle isozymes, respectively; the greater length of brain phosphorylase is entirely due to an extension at the far C-terminal portion of the protein. The muscle and brain isozymes share greater identity with regard to nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, codon usage, and nucleotide composition than either do with the liver sequence, suggesting a closer evolutionary relationship between them. Spot blot hybridization of the brain phosphorylase cDNA to laser-sorted human chromosome fractions, and Southern blot analysis of hamster/human hybrid cell line DNA reveals that the exact homolog of the newly cloned cDNA maps to chromosome 20, but that a slightly less homologous gene is found on chromosome 10 as well. The liver and muscle genes have previously been localized to chromosomes 14 and 11, respectively. This suggests that the phosphorylase genes evolved by duplication and translocation of a common ancestral gene, leading to divergence of elements controlling gene expression and of structural features of the phosphorylase proteins that confer tissue-specific functional properties.",

Two groups of rats were obtained, preconditioned with a combination of exercise and diet to obtain either high (HG) or low (LG) muscle glycogen content. The cellular distribution of GS was studied using subcellular fractionation and confocal microscopy of immunostained single muscle fibres. Stimulation of GS activity in HG and LG muscle was obtained with insulin or contractions in the perfused rat hindlimb model. 3. We demonstrate that GS translocates from a glycogen-enriched membrane fraction to a cytoskeleton fraction when glycogen levels are decreased. Confocal microscopy supports the biochemical observations that the subcellular localization of GS is influenced by muscle glycogen content. GS was not found in the nucleus. 4. Investigation of the effect of glycogen content on GS activity in basal and insulin- and contraction-stimulated muscle shows that glycogen has a strong inhibitory effect on GS activity. Our data demonstrate that glycogen is a more potent regulator of glycogen synthase activity than insulin. Furthermore we show that the contraction-induced increase in GS activity is merely a result of a decrease in muscle glycogen content. 5. In conclusion, the present study shows that GS localization is influenced by muscle glycogen content and that not only basal but also insulin- and contraction-stimulated GS activity is strongly regulated by glycogen content in skeletal muscle.",

In the present study, we used transmission electron microscopy to investigate the effect of disuse and aging on human skeletal muscle glycogen and mitochondria content in subsarcolemmal (SS), intermyofibrillar (IMF), and intramyofibrillar (intra) localizations. Five young (\u223c23 yr) and five old (\u223c66 yr) recreationally active men had their quadriceps muscle immobilized for 2 wk by whole leg casting. Biopsies were obtained from m. vastus lateralis before and after the immobilization period. Immobilization induced a decrement of intra glycogen content by 54% (P &lt; 0.001) in both age groups and in two ultrastructurally distinct fiber types, whereas the content of IMF and SS glycogen remained unchanged. A localization-dependent decrease (P = 0.03) in mitochondria content following immobilization was found in both age groups, where SS mitochondria decreased by 33% (P = 0.02), superficial IMF mitochondria decreased by 20% (P = 0.05), and central IMF mitochondria remained unchanged. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate a localization-dependent adaptation to immobilization in glycogen and mitochondria content of skeletal muscles of both young and old individuals. Specifically, this suggests that short-term disuse preferentially affects glycogen particles located inside the myofibrils and that mitochondria volume plasticity can be dependent on the distance to the fiber border.",

The metabolism of glycogen, the location of which is confined to astrocytes, is affected by norepinephrine (NE), and hence, adrenergic signaling in the astrocyte might affect glutamate homeostasis with implications for excitatory neurotransmission and possibly excitotoxic neurodegeneration. In order to study this putative correlation, cultured astrocytes were incubated with 2.5 mM [U-(13)C]glucose in the presence and absence of NE as a time course for 1 h. Employing mass spectrometry, labeling in intracellular metabolites was determined. Moreover, the involvement of Ca(2+) in the noradrenergic response was studied. In unstimulated astrocytes, the labeling pattern of glutamate, aspartate, malate and citrate confirmed important roles for pyruvate carboxylation and oxidative decarboxylation in astrocytic glucose metabolism. Importantly, pyruvate carboxylation was best visualized at 10 min of incubation. The abundance and pattern of labeling in lactate and alanine indicated not only an extensive activity of malic enzyme (initial step for pyruvate recycling) but also a high degree of compartmentalization of the pyruvate pool. Stimulating with 1 \u03bcM NE had no effect on labeling patterns and glycogen metabolism, whereas 100 \u03bcM NE increased glutamate labeling and decreased labeling in alanine, the latter supposedly due to dilution from degradation of non-labeled glycogen. It is suggested that further experiments uncovering the correlation between adrenergic and glutamatergic pathways should be performed in order to gain further insight into the role of astrocytes in brain function and dysfunction, the latter including excitotoxicity.",

Glycogen turnover is extremely rapid in the brain, especially during sudden increased demand when glucose supplies are insufficient. Previous culture studies have reported on the glycogenolytic effect of noradrenaline on 3--4 week-old primary mouse astrocyte cultures. This effect is believed to be mediated by the beta-adrenergic-cAMP signal transduction system. Recent evidence has shown a drop in forebrain glycogen levels at a specific time point during memory formation for a passive avoidance task in the day-old chick. This 'memory-related' glycogenolysis may be initiated by noradrenaline-induced rises in cAMP occurring around this point, but it is unknown whether astrocytic glycogenolysis is is stimulated by noradrenaline in day-old chicks. This question was approached in the present study and it was shown that noradrenaline is capable of stimulating both cAMP formation and glycogen breakdown in chick primary astrocyte cultures at developmental age (10-14 days in culture) comparable to the newborn chick. In contrast, noradrenaline did not have a corresponding glycogenolytic effect on 10-day-old mouse astrocyte cultures (equivalent to the 1-week mouse), although it induced a considerable amount of glycogen breakdown in older cultures (18 and 24-26 days).",

Thus, depletion of glycogen during prolonged, exhausting exercise may contribute to muscle fatigue by causing decreased Ca(2+) release inside the muscle. These data provide indications of a signal that links energy utilization, i.e. muscle contraction, with the energy content in the muscle, thereby inhibiting a detrimental depletion of the muscle energy store.",

Praised or disputed, the concept has never ceased to attract attention, leading to critical advances and unexpected insights. Here, we summarize recent experimental evidence further supporting the main tenets of the model. Thus, evidence for distinct metabolic phenotypes between neurons (mainly oxidative) and astrocytes (mainly glycolytic) have been provided by genomics and classical metabolic approaches. Moreover, it has become clear that astrocytes act as a syncytium to distribute energy substrates such as lactate to active neurones. Glycogen, the main energy reserve located in astrocytes, is used as a lactate source to sustain glutamatergic neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Lactate is also emerging as a neuroprotective agent as well as a key signal to regulate blood flow. Characterization of monocarboxylate transporter regulation indicates a possible involvement in synaptic plasticity and memory. Finally, several modeling studies captured the implications of such findings for many brain functions. The ANLS model now represents a useful, experimentally based framework to better understand the coupling between neuronal activity and energetics as it relates to neuronal plasticity, neurodegeneration, and functional brain imaging.",

A., Cuss\u00f3, R., Qvortrup, K., Nielsen, J. N., Wojtaszewki, J. F., Wojtaszewki, J. F., Hardie, D. G., Stewart, G., Hansen, B. F., and Ploug, T. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 23165-23172). In the present study we investigate the regulation of human muscle GS activity by glycogen, exercise, and insulin. Using immunocytochemistry we investigate the existence and relevance of GS intracellular compartmentalization during exercise and during glycogen re-synthesis. The results show that GS intrinsic activity is strongly dependent on glycogen levels and that such regulation involves associated dephosphorylation at sites 2+2a, 3a, and 3a + 3b. Furthermore, we report the existence of several glycogen metabolism regulatory mechanisms based on GS intracellular compartmentalization. After exhausting exercise, epinephrine-induced protein kinase A activation leads to GS site 1b phosphorylation targeting the enzyme to intramyofibrillar glycogen particles, which are preferentially used during muscle contraction. On the other hand, when phosphorylated at sites 2+2a, GS is preferentially associated with subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar glycogen particles. Finally, we verify the existence in human vastus lateralis muscle of the previously reported mechanism of glycogen metabolism regulation in rabbit tibialis anterior muscle. After overnight low muscle glycogen level and/or in response to exhausting exercise-induced glycogenolysis, GS is associated with spherical structures at the I-band of sarcomeres.",

The submitochondrial and subsynaptic distribution patterns of phosphorylase kinase revealed high overt activity in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and high latent activities in mitochondrial membranes, and synaptic vesicles, membranes and mitochondria. The Ca(2+)-dependency of soluble phosphorylase kinase was similar to that of microsomal enzyme but higher than that of other particulate enzyme forms. Mitochondrial phosphorylase kinase showed a higher pH 6.8:8.2 activity ratio than the soluble and the microsomal enzyme. The rate of inactivation of cytosolic phosphorylase kinase by proteinase K was higher than that of microsomal and mitochondrial enzymes. Antibodies against rabbit skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase effectively inhibited both cytosolic and microsomal enzyme but failed to significantly affect the kinase activity present in intact mitochondria and intermembrane space.

Evidence is presented that CNS axonal function can be supported in the absence of glucose by intrinsic energy reserves provided through the breakdown of astrocytic glycogen. It is argued that energy is transferred from astrocytes to axons in the form of lactate, which is able to maintain axonal function when substituted for glucose. These observations complement the increasingly convincing hypothesis that astrocytes and neurons interact metabolically, both in the course of normal activity and under pathological conditions such as ischemia.

The two largest deposits in mammals are in the liver and skeletal muscle but many cells are capable synthesizing glycogen. Its accumulation and utilization are under elaborate controls involving primarily covalent phosphorylation and allosteric ligand binding. Both muscle and liver glycogen reserves are important for whole body glucose metabolism and their replenishment is linked hormonally to nutritional status. Control differs between muscle and liver in part due to the existence of different tissue-specific isoforms at key steps. Control of synthesis is shared between transport into the muscle and the step catalyzed by glycogen synthase. Breakdown of liver glycogen, as part of blood glucose homeostasis, is also in response to nutritional cues. Muscle glycogen serves only to fuel muscular activity and its utilization is controlled by muscle contraction and by catecholamines. Though the number of enzymes directly involved in the metabolism of glycogen is quite small, many more proteins act indirectly in a regulatory capacity. Defects in the basic metabolizing enzymes lead to severe consequences whereas, with some exceptions, mutations in the regulatory proteins appear to cause a more subtle phenotypic change.",

A 3rd phosphorylase isozyme, observed previously in hepatomas and fetal tissues by isoelectric focusing and by immunochemical titration, was also separated by polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. It was observed commonly in various rat hepatomas, together with variable activities of the liver type, depending on the degree of differentiation. This isozyme is nearly the sole type in placenta and early embryo, and in liver and skeletal muscle it is replaced during fetal development with the organ-specific liver and muscle type. In adult rat brain the fetal type is retained at low levels, together with the muscle type. In kidney, spleen, testis, uterus, lung, and stomach, the fetal type is present together with the liver type. This isozyme in hepatomas and adult brain is identical with the fetal-type, as determined by Ouchterlony double diffusion and activity inhibition tests. Thus, it is considered to be a prototype whose appearance in hepatomas is one of many known examples of fetal protein expression in cancer.

In addition to this the possibility exists that glycogen, which functions as a glucose storage molecule and which is only present in astrocytes, could play a role not only during aglycemia but also during normoglycemia. These issues are discussed and it is concluded that both glucose and lactate are of importance for the maintenance of normal glutamatergic and GABAergic activity. However, with regard to maintenance of an adequate capacity for glutamate transport, it appears that glucose metabolism via the glycolytic pathway plays a fundamental role. Additionally, evidence is presented to support the notion that glycogen turnover may play an important role in this context. Moreover, it should be noted that the amino acid neurotransmitters can be used as metabolic substrates. This requires pyruvate recycling, a process that is discussed as well.",

    "abstxt": "Glutamatergic neurotransmission accounts for a considerable part of energy consumption related to signaling in the brain. Chemical energy is provided by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formed in glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle combined with oxidative phosphorylation. It is not clear whether ATP generated in these pathways is equivalent in relation to fueling of the energy-requiring processes, i.e., vesicle filling, transport, and enzymatic processing in the glutamatergic tripartite synapse (the astrocyte and pre- and postsynapse). The role of astrocytic glycogenolysis in maintaining theses processes also has not been fully elucidated. Cultured astrocytes and neurons were utilized to monitor these processes related to glutamatergic neurotransmission. Inhibitors of glycolysis and TCA cycle in combination with pathway-selective substrates were used to study glutamate uptake and release monitored with D-aspartate. Western blotting of glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) was performed to determine whether these enzymes are associated with the cell membrane. We show that ATP formed in glycolysis is superior to that generated by oxidative phosphorylation in providing energy for glutamate uptake both in astrocytes and in neurons. The neuronal vesicular glutamate release was less dependent on glycolytic ATP. Dependence of glutamate uptake on glycolytic ATP may be at least partially explained by a close association in the membrane of GAPDH and PGK and the glutamate transporters. It may be suggested that these enzymes form a complex with the transporters and the Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase, the latter providing the sodium gradient required for the transport process.",

    "abstxt": "Research over the past two decades has renewed the interest in lactate, no longer as a useless end product of anaerobic glycolysis in brain (and other tissues), but as an oxidative substrate for energy metabolism. While this topic would be considered blasphemy only three decades ago, much recent evidence indicates that lactate does play a major role in aerobic energy metabolism in the brain, the heart, skeletal muscle, and possibly in any other tissue and organ. Nevertheless, this concept has challenged the old dogma and ignited a fierce debate, especially among neuroscientists, pitting the supporters of glucose as the major oxidative energy substrate against those who support lactate as a possible alternative to glucose under certain conditions. Meanwhile, researchers working on energy metabolism in skeletal muscle have taken great strides toward bridging between these two extreme positions, while avoiding the high decibels of an emotional debate. Employing their findings along with the existing old and new data on cerebral energy metabolism, it is postulated here that lactate is the only major product of cerebral (and other tissues) glycolysis, whether aerobic or anaerobic, neuronal or astrocytic, under rest or during activation. Consequently, this postulate entails that lactate is a major, if not the only, substrate for the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle. If proven true, this hypothesis could provide better understanding of the biochemistry and physiology of (cerebral) energy metabolism, while holding important implications in the field of neuroimaging. Concomitantly, it could satisfy both 'glucoseniks' and 'lactatians' in the ongoing debate.",

Under basal physiological conditions in the adult mammalian brain, glucose oxidation is nearly complete so that the oxygen-to-glucose index (OGI), given by the ratio of CMR(O(2))/CMR(Glc), is close to the stoichiometric value of 6. However, a survey of functional imaging data suggests that the OGI is activity dependent, moving further below the oxidative value of 6 as activity is increased. Brain lactate concentrations also increase with stimulation. These results had led to the concept that brain activation is supported by anaerobic glucose metabolism, which was inconsistent with basal glucose oxidation. These differences are resolved here by a proposed model of glucose energetics, in which a fraction of glucose is cycled through the cerebral glycogen pool, a fraction that increases with degree of brain activation. The &quot;glycogen shunt,&quot; although energetically less efficient than glycolysis, is followed because of its ability to supply glial energy in milliseconds for rapid neurotransmitter clearance, as a consequence of which OGI is lowered and lactate is increased. The value of OGI observed is consistent with passive lactate efflux, driven by the observed lactate concentration, for the few experiments with complete data. Although the OGI changes during activation, the energies required per neurotransmitter release (neuronal) and clearance (glial) are constant over a wide range of brain activity.",

The objective of this study was to elucidate how brain glycogen and neurotransmitter homeostasis are affected by these conditions. [1-(13)C]glucose was administered to Zucker obese (ZO) and Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Sprague-Dawley (SprD), Zucker lean (ZL), and ZDF lean rats were used as controls. Several brain regions were analyzed for glycogen levels along with (13)C-labeling and content of glutamate, glutamine, GABA, aspartate, and alanine. Blood glucose concentrations and (13)C enrichment were determined. (13)C-labeling in glutamate was lower in ZO and ZDF rats in comparison with the controls. The molecular carbon labeling (MCL) ratio between alanine and glutamate was higher in the ZDF rats. The MCL ratios of glutamine and glutamate were decreased in the cerebellum of the ZO and the ZDF rats. Glycogen levels were also lower in this region. These results suggest that the obese and type 2 diabetic models were associated with lower brain glucose metabolism. Glucose metabolism through the TCA cycle was more decreased than glycolytic activity. Furthermore, reduced glutamate-glutamine cycling was also observed in the obese and type 2 diabetic states.",

Brain glycogen is located in astrocytes and being a carbohydrate reservoir it contributes to glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, glycogen has been indicated to be important for proper neurotransmission under normal conditions. Previous findings from our laboratory suggested that glucose metabolism was reduced in type 2 diabetes, and thus we wanted to investigate more specifically how brain glycogen metabolism contributes to maintain energy status in the type 2 diabetic state. Also, our objective was to elucidate the contribution of glycogen to support neurotransmitter glutamate and GABA homeostasis. A glycogen phosphorylase (GP) inhibitor was administered to Sprague-Dawley (SprD) and Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats in vivo and after one day of treatment [1-\u00b9\u00b3C]glucose was used to monitor metabolism. Brain levels of \u00b9\u00b3C labeling in glucose, lactate, alanine, glutamate, GABA, glutamine and aspartate were determined. Our results show that inhibition of brain glycogen metabolism reduced the amounts of glutamate in both the control and type 2 diabetes models. The reduction in glutamate was associated with a decrease in the pyruvate carboxylase/pyruvate dehydrogenase ratio in the control but not the type 2 diabetes model. In the type 2 diabetes model GABA levels were increased suggesting that brain glycogen serves a role in maintaining a proper ratio between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in type 2 diabetes. Both the control and the type 2 diabetic states had a compensatory increase in glucose-derived \u00b9\u00b3C processed through the TCA cycle following inhibition of glycogen degradation. Finally, it was indicated that the type 2 diabetes model might have an augmented necessity for compensatory upregulation at the glycolytic level.",

However, to what extent energy derived from glycogen is consumed by astrocytes themselves or is transferred to the neurons in the form of lactate for oxidative metabolism to proceed is at present unclear. The significance of glycogen in fueling glutamate uptake into astrocytes was specifically addressed in cultured astrocytes. Moreover, the objective was to elucidate whether glycogen derived energy is important for maintaining glutamatergic neurotransmission, induced by repetitive exposure to NMDA in co-cultures of cerebellar neurons and astrocytes. In the astrocytes it was shown that uptake of the glutamate analogue D-[3H]aspartate was impaired when glycogen degradation was inhibited irrespective of the presence of glucose, signifying that energy derived from glycogen degradation is important for the astrocytic compartment. By inhibiting glycogen degradation in co-cultures it was evident that glycogen provides energy to sustain glutamatergic neurotransmission, i.e. release and uptake of glutamate. The relocation of glycogen derived lactate to the neuronal compartment was investigated by employing d-lactate, a competitive substrate for the monocarboxylate transporters. Neurotransmitter release was affected by the presence of d-lactate indicating that glycogen derived energy is important not only in the astrocytic but also in the neuronal compartment.",

    "abstxt": "In recent years evidence has accumulated indicating the presence of functional receptors for most neurotransmitters on astrocytes. In particular, receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase have been demonstrated, in primary astrocyte cultures, for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), noradrenaline (NA) and adenosine. Here we provide, in primary cultures of cerebral cortical astrocytes prepared from neonatal mice, a detailed characterization of a cAMP-dependent process elicited by VIP, NA and adenosine, i.e. the hydrolysis of glycogen. The EC50s for the glycogenolytic effect of VIP, NA and adenosine are 3, 20 and 800 nM, respectively. The initial rate of glycogen hydrolysis is, in nmol/mg prot/min, 9.1 for VIP and 7.5 for NA. The effect of NA is predominantly mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, although an alpha 1-adrenergic component, acting most likely through protein kinase C activation, is also present. The action of VIP is mimicked by peptides sharing sequence homologies such as PHI and secretin. Glutamate, GABA, carbachol and the peptides NPY and somatostatin do not influence glycogen levels. The glycogen content of the cultures can be markedly increased by anabolic factors present in fetal calf serum, by high (e.g. 25 mM) glucose in the medium and by 48-h pretreatment of the cultures with dibutyryl cAMP. These results indicate that the glycogen content of astrocytes is under the dynamic control of various factors, including certain neurotransmitters. They also further stress the notion of a functional interaction between neurons and glial cells aimed at maintaining local energy metabolism homeostasis.",

    "abstxt": "A stimulation of glycogenolysis in astrocytes by adrenergic agonists has repeatedly been demonstrated in the literature. However, some confusion exists regarding which type of adrenergic receptor subtype is involved, and little information is available about rates of glycogenolysis and potencies of adrenergic agonists. In the present study, we have investigated these parameters using primary cultures of mouse astrocytes which constitute a reliable model for their in vivo counterparts. Antagonists as well as agonist studies revealed that noradrenaline acts both on a beta- and on an alpha 2-receptor. Isoproterenol and clonidine, agonists acting relatively specifically on only one of these receptor subtypes could, on their own, stimulate glycogenolysis and the effect by noradrenaline could be inhibited by alprenolol (beta-adrenergic antagonist) and/or yohimbine (alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist) but not by prazosin (alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist). Excess potassium also stimulated glycogenolysis but this effect was not antagonized by adrenergic antagonists, alone or in combination. The involvement of an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor in a homogeneous culture of astrocytes provides proof that not all alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in brain are presynaptic. The maximum rate of stimulated glycogenolysis was calculated to be 3-7 nmol/min per mg protein. Computer analysis showed that the EC50 values for noradrenaline, isoproterenol and clonidine were 4.6 x 10(-8) M, 3.0 x 10(-7) M, and 6.5 x 10(-7) M, respectively.",

The effect was, at least partly, exerted on the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase step. The EC50 value for noradrenaline on lactate formation was significantly lower (60 nM) than that on oxidative metabolism (1,900 nM). Studies with specific adrenergic agonists and antagonists showed that various receptor subtypes are involved.

Lumped constant values were higher in hypoglycemia and declined from a value of 1.2 at the lowest arterial plasma glucose level (1.9 mM) to about 0.48 in normoglycemia. The distribution of glucose, and therefore also of the lumped constant, was found to remain relatively uniform throughout the brain at the lowest plasma glucose levels studied. lCMRglc in moderate, insulin-induced hypoglycemia (mean arterial plasma glucose concentration +/- SD of 2.4 +/- 0.3 mM) was determined with the appropriate lumped constant corresponding to the animal's plasma glucose concentration and compared with the results obtained in six normoglycemic rats. The weighted average rate of glucose utilization for the brain as a whole was significantly depressed by 14% in the hypoglycemic animals, i.e., 61 mumols/100 g/min in hypoglycemia compared to 71 mumols/100 g/min in the normoglycemic controls (p less than 0.05). lCMRglc was lower in 47 of 49 structures examined but statistically significantly below the rate in normoglycemic rats in only six structures (p less than 0.05) by multiple comparison statistics.

Disrupting the expression of the astrocytic lactate transporters monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) or MCT1 causes amnesia, which, like LTP impairment, is rescued by L-lactate but not equicaloric glucose. Disrupting the expression of the neuronal lactate transporter MCT2 also leads to amnesia that is unaffected by either L-lactate or glucose, suggesting that lactate import into neurons is necessary for long-term memory. Glycogenolysis and astrocytic lactate transporters are also critical for the induction of molecular changes required for memory formation, including the induction of phospho-CREB, Arc, and phospho-cofilin.

We have shown that glycogen utilization increases during tactile stimulation of the rat face and vibrissae. Conversely, decreased neuronal activity during hibernation and anesthesia is accompanied by a marked increase in brain glycogen content. These observations support a link between neuronal activity and glial glycogen metabolism. The energetics of glycogen metabolism suggest that glial glycogen is mobilized to meet increased metabolic demands of glia rather than to serve as a substrate for neuronal activity. An advantage to the use of glycogen may be the potentially faster generation of ATP from glycogen than from glucose. Alternatively, glycogen could be utilized if glucose supply is transiently insufficient during the onset of increased metabolic activity. Brain glycogen may have a dynamic role as a buffer between the abrupt increases in focal metabolic demands that occur during normal brain activity and the compensatory changes in focal cerebral blood flow or oxidative metabolism.",

Glycogen is the major energy reserve in brain, and it is localized almost exclusively to astrocytes. Using murine cortical cell cultures containing both glia and neurons, we examined the effect of altered glial glycogen stores on neuronal survival following glucose deprivation. As previously reported, cultures exposed for several hours to media lacking glucose developed widespread neuronal degeneration without glial degeneration. If glial astrocyte glycogen content was increased to 2-3 times control levels by a 24-h pretreatment with 1 microM insulin or 0.5 mM methionine sulfoximine (MSO), glucose deprivation-induced neuronal degeneration was attenuated. These protective effects were blocked if glycogen levels were reduced back to control levels by a 30-min exposure to 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP or 20 microM norepinephrine prior to glucose deprivation. Astrocyte glycogen stores may be an important factor influencing neuronal survival under conditions of energy substrate limitation.",

Glucose concentrations paralleled glycogen, ranging from 5.9 to 10.8 nmol/mg protein. Glycogen, glucose, and lactate were measured during complete global ischaemia (decapitation) to assess regional differences in ischaemic metabolism. Those regions which in normal brain contain higher glycogen and glucose stores were found to maintain significantly higher levels of glycogen and glucose for at least 2 minutes of ischaemia. Lactate accumulated to highest levels after 30 minutes of ischaemia in those regions with highest glucose and glycogen stores. Lactate levels did not, however, rise above 90 nmol/mg protein in any brain region, a level well below that considered potentially neurotoxic.

In this report, we show that the activity of R5/PTG is regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We demonstrate that AMPK interacts physically with R5/PTG and modifies its basal phosphorylation status. We have also mapped the major phosphorylation sites of R5/PTG by mass spectrometry analysis, observing that phosphorylation of Ser-8 and Ser-268 increased upon activation of AMPK. We have recently described that the activity of R5/PTG is down-regulated by the laforin-malin complex, composed of a dual specificity phosphatase (laforin) and an E3-ubiquitin ligase (malin). We now demonstrate that phosphorylation of R5/PTG at Ser-8 by AMPK accelerates its laforin/malin-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, which results in a decrease of its glycogenic activity. Thus, our results define a novel role of AMPK in glycogen homeostasis.",

Activation of phosphorylase by 100 microM noradrenaline is mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors and does not require the copresence of adenosine. The role of the concomitant small increase in cyclic AMP is questioned. Short-term treatment with EGTA or LaCl3 abolishes the noradrenaline activation of phosphorylase, pointing to a critical role of extracellular calcium. Depolarization by 25 mM K+ or 100 microM veratridine produces a rapid and large (fourfold) activation of phosphorylase. Only veratridine increases the cyclic AMP levels; exogenous adenosine deaminase essentially blocks this cyclic AMP accumulation but not the phosphorylase activation. A half-maximal activation of phosphorylase occurs at about 12 mM K+. Addition of EGTA or LaCl3 reduces the effect of both depolarizations to a slight and transient activation of phosphorylase. These results indicate that activation of glycogen phosphorylase by K+ or veratridine occurs by a cyclic AMP-independent and calcium-dependent mechanism. The calcium dependency of brain phosphorylase kinase renders this kinase the prime target enzyme for regulation of glycogenolysis by calcium ions.",

This suppression was further ensured by a complex of laforin and malin, which are the two proteins whose mutations cause Lafora disease. The laforin-malin complex caused proteasome-dependent degradation both of the adaptor protein targeting to glycogen, PTG, which brings protein phosphatase 1 to MGS for activation, and of MGS itself. Enforced expression of PTG led to glycogen deposition in neurons and caused apoptosis. Therefore, the malin-laforin complex ensures a blockade of neuronal glycogen synthesis even under intense glycogenic conditions. Here we explain the formation of polyglucosan inclusions in Lafora disease by demonstrating a crucial role for laforin and malin in glycogen synthesis.",

It represents the fraction of metabolized glucose that passes through glycogen molecules prior to entering the glycolytic pathway. The present study was aimed at elucidating this pathway in cultured astrocytes from mouse exposed to agents such as a high [K+], D-aspartate and norepinephrine (NE) known to affect energy metabolism in response to neurotransmission. Glycogen shunt activity was assessed employing [1,6-13C]glucose, and the glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol (DAB) to block glycogen degradation. The label intensity in lactate, reflecting glycolytic activity, was determined by mass spectrometry. In the presence of NE a substantial glycogen shunt activity was observed, accounting for almost 40% of overall glucose metabolism. Moreover, when no metabolic stimulant was applied, a compensatory increase in glycolytic activity was seen when the shunt was inhibited by DAB. Actually the labeling in lactate exceeded that obtained when glycolysis and glycogen shunt both were operational, i.e. supercompensation. A similar phenomenon was seen when astrocytes were exposed to D-aspartate. In addition to glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity was monitored, analyzing labeling by mass spectrometry in glutamate which equilibrates with alpha-ketoglutarate. Both an elevated [K+] and D-aspartate induced an increased TCA cycle activity, which was altered when glycogen degradation was inhibited. Thus, the present study provides evidence that manipulation of glycogen metabolism affects both glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolism. Altogether, the results reveal a highly complex interaction between glycogenolysis and glycolysis, with the glycogen shunt playing a significant role in astrocytic energy metabolism.",

Its inhibitory effect on glycogen phosphorylase was studied in homogenates of brain tissue and astrocytes and IC50-values close to 400 nM were found. However, the concentration of DAB needed for inhibition of glycogen shunt activity, i.e. glucose metabolism via glycogen, in intact astrocytes was almost three orders of magnitude higher. Additionally, such complete inhibition required a pre-incubation period, a finding possibly reflecting a limited permeability of the astrocytic membrane. DAB did not affect the accumulation of 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate indicating that the transport of DAB is not mediated by the glucose transporter. DAB had no effect on enzymes involving glucose-6-phosphate, i.e. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucoisomerase and hexokinase. Furthermore, DAB was evaluated in a functional preparation of the isolated mouse optic nerve, in which its presence severely reduced the ability to sustain evoked compound action potentials in the absence of glucose, a condition in which glycogen serves as an important energy substrate. Based on the experimental findings, DAB can be used to evaluate glycogen shunt activity and its functional importance in intact brain tissue and cells at a concentration of 300-1000 muM and a pre-incubation period of 1 h.",

Axon function in the rat optic nerve (RON), a CNS white matter tract, was monitored by measuring the area of the stimulus-evoked compound action potential (CAP). Switching to glucose-free artificial CSF (aCSF) had no effect on the CAP area for approximately 30 min, after which the CAP rapidly failed. Exposure to glucose-free aCSF for 60 min caused irreversible injury, which was measured as incomplete recovery of the CAP. Glycogen content of the RON fell to a low stable level 30 min after glucose withdrawal, compatible with rapid use in the absence of glucose. An increase of glycogen content induced by high-glucose pretreatment increased the latency to CAP failure and improved CAP recovery. Conversely, a decrease of glycogen content induced by norepinephrine pretreatment decreased the latency to CAP failure and reduced CAP recovery. To determine whether lactate represented the fuel derived from glycogen and shuttled to axons, we used the lactate transport blockers quercetin, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (4-CIN), and p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonic acid (pCMBS). All transport blockers, when applied during glucose withdrawal, decreased latency to CAP failure and decreased CAP recovery. The inhibitors 4-CIN and pCMBS, but not quercetin, blocked lactate uptake by axons. These results indicated that, in the absence of glucose, astrocytic glycogen was broken down to lactate, which was transferred to axons for fuel.",

Significantly, these ACs are highly selective for capacitative Ca(2+) entry (CCE) over other modes of Ca(2+) increase. To directly address the possibility that these ACs reside in discrete Ca(2+) microdomains, we tethered a Ca(2+) sensor, GCaMP2, to the N-terminus of Ca(2+)-stimulated AC8. GCaMP2-AC8 measurements were compared with global, plasma membrane (PM)-targeted or Ca(2+)-insensitive AC2-targeted GCaMP2. In intact cells, GCaMP2-AC8 responded rapidly to CCE, but was largely unresponsive to other types of Ca(2+) rise. The global GCaMP2, PM-targeted GCaMP2 and GCaMP2-AC2 sensors reported large Ca(2+) fluxes during Ca(2+) mobilization and non-specific Ca(2+) entry, but were less responsive to CCE than GCaMP2-AC8. Our data reveal that different AC isoforms localize to distinct Ca(2+)-microdomains within the plasma membrane. AC2, which is regulated via protein kinase C, resides in a microdomain that is exposed to a range of widespread Ca(2+) signals seen throughout the cytosol. By contrast, a unique Ca(2+) microdomain surrounds AC8 that promotes selectivity for Ca(2+) signals arising from CCE, and optimizes CCE-mediated cAMP synthesis. This direct demonstration of discrete compartmentalized Ca(2+) signals associated with specific signalling proteins provides a remarkable insight into the functional organization of signalling microdomains.",

LD is caused by mutations in either the E3 ubiquitin ligase malin or the dual specificity phosphatase laforin. A hallmark of LD is the accumulation of insoluble glycogen in the cytoplasm of cells from most tissues. Glycogen metabolism is regulated by phosphorylation of key metabolic enzymes. One regulator of this phosphorylation is protein targeting to glycogen (PTG/R5), a scaffold protein that binds both glycogen and many of the enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis, including protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), glycogen synthase, phosphorylase, and laforin. Overexpression of PTG markedly increases glycogen accumulation, and decreased PTG expression decreases glycogen stores. To investigate if malin and laforin play a role in glycogen metabolism, we overexpressed PTG, malin, and laforin in tissue culture cells. We found that expression of malin or laforin decreased PTG-stimulated glycogen accumulation by 25%, and co-expression of malin and laforin abolished PTG-stimulated glycogen accumulation. Consistent with this result, we found that malin ubiquitinates PTG in a laforin-dependent manner, both in vivo and in vitro, and targets PTG for proteasome-dependent degradation. These results suggest an additional mechanism, involving laforin and malin, in regulating glycogen metabolism.",
