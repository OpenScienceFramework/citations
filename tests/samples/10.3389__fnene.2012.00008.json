    "abstxt": "Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO(2)), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) are important indices of healthy aging of the brain. Although a frequent topic of study, changes of CBF and CMRO(2) during normal aging are still controversial, as some authors find decreases of both CBF and CMRO(2) but increased OEF, while others find no change, and yet other find divergent changes. In this reanalysis of previously published results from positron emission tomography of healthy volunteers, we determined CMRO(2) and CBF in 66 healthy volunteers aged 21 to 81 years. The magnitudes of CMRO(2) and CBF declined in large parts of the cerebral cortex, including association areas, but the primary motor and sensory areas were relatively spared. We found significant increases of OEF in frontal and parietal cortices, excluding primary motor and somatosensory regions, and in the temporal cortex. Because of the inverse relation between OEF and capillary oxygen tension, increased OEF can compromise oxygen delivery to neurons, with possible perturbation of energy turnover. The results establish a possible mechanism of progression from healthy to unhealthy brain aging, as the regions most affected by age are the areas that are most vulnerable to neurodegeneration.",

    "abstxt": "Four children with self-inflicted strangulation injuries had cerebral blood flow determined by stable xenon computed tomography (XeCTCBF) within 24 hours of admission. All had suffered a severe hypoxic-ischemic cerebral injury; 3 initially had fixed pupils, all were apneic with varying bradyarrhythmias, and the initial mean arterial pH was 7.26 (+/- 0.18). The initial blood glucose values were greater than 300 mg/dl (334 and 351 mg/dl) in the 2 patients who died compared to the 2 who survived (104 and 295 mg/dl). The cardiac index was depressed during the first several days of hospitalization in the 2 patients who died (less than 2.0 L/min/m2) compared to the 2 who survived. Total CBF was normal (63 +/- 8 ml/min/100 gm) and local variations in CBF were present. PCO2 reactivity was determined by hyperventilating the 4 patients for 20 min from an end tidal PCO2 of 39 +/- 3 torr to 29 +/- 1 torr and then repeating the XeCTCBF study. Marked regional variability in the CBF/PCO2 response was observed, ranging from 0.5-5.5 ml/min/100 gm/torr PCO2. In the 2 patients who died, the CBF/PCO2 was decreased (1.2 ml/min/100 gm/torr PCO2) compared to the 2 patients who survived (2.1 ml/min/100 gm/torr PCO2). Although CBF was normal in these 4 children, the hyperventilation response was depressed, variable, and even paradoxical which may be important in the evolution of further brain injury and is a critical factor in deciding whether hyperventilation may be of clinical benefit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstxt": "Following inhibition of mitochondrial respiration neurons die rapidly, whereas astrocytes utilize glycolytically-generated ATP to increase their mitochondrial membrane potential, thus becoming more resistant to pro-apoptotic stimuli. Neurons are unable to increase glycolysis due to the lack of activity of the glycolysis-promoting enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase, isoform 3 (PFKFB3). In neurons, PFKFB3 is degraded constantly via the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)- CDH1. Glucose metabolism in neurons is directed mainly to the pentose phosphate pathway, leading to regeneration of reduced glutathione. In addition to their relevance to brain physiology and pathophysiology, these observations suggest that APC/C-CDH1 might link activation of glycolysis and cell proliferation as it is also involved in the regulation of cell cycle proteins.",

This study investigated whether impairments in cerebral hemodynamics can be detected in early-stage AD. Nine patients with mild AD and eight cognitively normal controls matched for age underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological evaluation, followed by assessment of steady-state cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV, transcranial Doppler), blood pressure (BP, Finapres), and cerebrovascular resistance index (BP/CBFV). Cerebral hemodynamics were quantified using spectral and transfer function analysis of BP and CBFV in rest, during standing up after squat, and during repeated squat-stand maneuvers. Compared to controls, AD patients had lower CBFV and higher cerebrovascular resistance index, unexplained by brain atrophy. Low-frequency variability of BP was enhanced, suggesting impaired arterial baroreflex function. However, CBFV variability was reduced despite enhanced BP variability, and dynamic cerebral autoregulation was not impaired. In conclusion, despite a distinct pattern of altered cerebral hemodynamics, AD patients may have normal autoregulation. However, the challenges for autoregulation in AD are higher, as our data show enhanced BP fluctuations. Increased cerebral vasoconstriction or reduced vasomotion also may attenuate CBFV variability.",

    "abstxt": "Clinical transcranial Doppler assessment of cerebral vasomotor reactivity (CVMR) uses linear regression of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) vs. end-tidal CO(2) (Pet(CO(2))) under steady-state conditions. However, the cerebral blood flow (CBF)-Pet(CO(2)) relationship is nonlinear, even for moderate changes in CO(2). Moreover, CBF is increased by increases in arterial blood pressure (ABP) during hypercapnia. We used a modified rebreathing protocol to estimate CVMR during transient breath-by-breath changes in CBFV and Pet(CO(2)). Ten healthy subjects (6 men) performed 15 s of hyperventilation followed by 5 min of rebreathing, with supplemental O(2) to maintain arterial oxygen saturation constant. To minimize effects of changes in ABP on CVMR estimation, cerebrovascular conductance index (CVCi) was calculated. CBFV-Pet(CO(2)) and CVCi-Pet(CO(2)) relationships were quantified by both linear and nonlinear logistic regression. In three subjects, muscle sympathetic nerve activity was recorded. From hyperventilation to rebreathing, robust changes occurred in Pet(CO(2)) (20-61 Torr), CBFV (-44 to +104% of baseline), CVCi (-39 to +64%), and ABP (-19 to +23%) (all P &lt; 0.01). Muscle sympathetic nerve activity increased by 446% during hypercapnia. The linear regression slope of CVCi vs. Pet(CO(2)) was less steep than that of CBFV (3 vs. 5%/Torr; P = 0.01). Logistic regression of CBF-Pet(CO(2)) (r(2) = 0.97) and CVCi-Pet(CO(2)) (r(2) = 0.93) was superior to linear regression (r(2) = 0.91, r(2) = 0.85; P = 0.01). CVMR was maximal (6-8%/Torr) for Pet(CO(2)) of 40-50 Torr. In conclusion, CBFV and CVCi responses to transient changes in Pet(CO(2)) can be described by a nonlinear logistic function, indicating that CVMR estimation varies within the range from hypocapnia to hypercapnia. Furthermore, quantification of the CVCi-Pet(CO(2)) relationship may minimize the effects of changes in ABP on the estimation of CVMR. The method developed provides insight into CVMR under transient breath-by-breath changes in CO(2).",

We used a recently developed two-photon microscopy method, based on a novel phosphorescent nanoprobe, to image tissue oxygenation in the rat primary sensory cortex in response to sensory stimulation. Our measurements showed that a stimulus-evoked increase in tissue pO\u2082 depended on the baseline pO\u2082 level. In particular, during sustained stimulation, the steady-state pO\u2082 at low-baseline locations remained at the baseline, despite large pO\u2082 increases elsewhere. In contrast to the steady state, where pO\u2082 never decreased below the baseline, transient decreases occurred during the &quot;initial dip&quot; and &quot;poststimulus undershoot.&quot; These results suggest that the increase in blood oxygenation during the hemodynamic response, which has been perceived as a paradox, may serve to prevent a sustained oxygenation drop at tissue locations that are remote from the vascular feeding sources.",

Although the diverse triggers of the neurodegenerative processes and their interactions are still the topic of extensive debate, the possible contribution of cerebrovascular deficiencies has been vigorously promoted in recent years. Various forms of cerebrovascular insufficiency such as reduced blood supply to the brain or disrupted microvascular integrity in cortical regions may occupy an initiating or intermediate position in the chain of events ending with cognitive failure. When, for example, vasoconstriction takes over a dominating role in the cerebral vessels, the perfusion rate of the brain can considerably decrease causing directly or through structural vascular damage a drop in cerebral glucose utilization. Consequently, cerebral metabolism can suffer a setback leading to neuronal damage and a concomitant suboptimal cognitive capacity. The present review focuses on the microvascular aspects of neurodegenerative processes in aging and AD with special attention to cerebral blood flow, neural metabolic changes and the abnormalities in microvascular ultrastructure. In this context, a few of the specific triggers leading to the prominent cerebrovascular pathology, as well as the potential neurological outcome of the compromised cerebral microvascular system are also going to be touched upon to a certain extent, without aiming at total comprehensiveness. Finally, a set of animal models are going to be presented that are frequently used to uncover the functional relationship between cerebrovascular factors and the damage to neural networks.",

    "abstxt": "The reactions of cerebral metabolism to imposed changes of cerebral blood flow (CBF) are poorly understood. A common explanation of the mismatched CBF and oxygen consumption (CMR(O(2))) during neuronal excitation holds that blood flow rises more than oxygen consumption to compensate for an absent oxygen reserve in brain mitochondria. The claim conversely implies that oxygen consumption must decline when blood flow declines. As the prevailing rate of reaction of oxygen with cytochrome c oxidase is linked to the tension of oxygen, the claim fails to explain how oxygen consumption is maintained during moderate reductions of CBF imposed by hyperventilation (hypocapnia) or cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. To resolve this contradiction, we extended the previously published oxygen delivery model with a term allowing for the adjustment of the affinity of cytochrome c oxidase to a prevailing oxygen tension. The extended model predicted constant oxygen consumption at moderately reduced blood flow. We determined the change of affinity of cytochrome c oxidase in the extended model by measuring CBF in seven, and CMR(O(2)) in five, young healthy volunteers before and during COX inhibition with indomethacin. The average CBF declined 35%, while neither regional nor average CMR(O(2)) changed significantly. The adjustment of cytochrome c oxidase affinity to the declining oxygen delivery could be ascribed to a hypothetical factor with several properties in common with nitric oxide.",

Compared to HC subjects, blood flow and energy metabolism had declined in all gray matter regions of the brain in patients with HE but not significantly in patients with CL. Analysis of flow-metabolism coupling indicated that blood flow declined in HE as a consequence of reduced brain energy metabolism implied by the calculation of increased mitochondrial oxygen tensions that patients with HE were unable to utilize. We ascribe the inability to use the delivered oxygen of patients with HE to a specific inhibition associated with oxidative metabolism in mitochondria.",

    "sponsors": [], 
    "abstxt": "There is evidence that the metabolic responses to afferent and efferent nervous activity are dissociated at sites of neuronal excitation in brain. Whether efferent activity follows afferent activity depends on the responsiveness of postsynaptic neurons, which in turn depends on the summation of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. The afferent activity excites the presynaptic terminals and astrocytes, whereas the efferent activity arises from excitation of the dendrites of projection neurons. Measurements in vivo indicate that primary stimulation, elicited by simple stimuli, gives rise to limited increases of energy metabolism associated with afferent activity. Reports show that a major consequence of afferent activity, in addition to the release of excitatory neurotransmitters from presynaptic terminals and the import of glutamate by astrocytes, is the establishment of rates of blood flow commensurate with increased rates of oxidative energy metabolism associated with efferent activity projecting from the site of activation. Increased flow rates overcome the inherent diffusion limitation of oxygen delivery, while increased rates of glycolysis elevate tissue pyruvate contents, to which oxygen consumption rates are matched. In vivo, neurons in the baseline condition sustain no net import of pyruvate or lactate, and the reported changes of metabolism subserving afferent and efferent activity are additive rather than linked by significant additional transfer of pyruvate or lactate from astrocytes. The dissociation of blood flow changes from efferent activity weakens the identification of functional states by changes of blood flow alone. It raises the possibility that uncoupling of flow from oxidative metabolism occurs at sites of low efferent activity, such that dissociations of flow and glycolysis from oxygen consumption signify imbalances of afferent and efferent activity.",

For example, endothelial dysfunction has been implicated as a crucial event in the development of several CNS disorders, such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-associated neurocognitive disorder and traumatic brain injury. Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) as a result of disruption of tight junctions and transporters, leads to increased leukocyte transmigration and is an early event in the pathology of these disorders. The brain endothelium is highly reactive because it serves as both a source of, and a target for, inflammatory proteins and reactive oxygen species. BBB breakdown thus leads to neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of CNS disease. Furthermore, the physiology and pathophysiology of endothelial cells are closely linked to the functioning of their mitochondria, and mitochondrial dysfunction is another important mediator of disease pathology in the brain. The high concentration of mitochondria in cerebrovascular endothelial cells might account for the sensitivity of the BBB to oxidant stressors. Here, we discuss how greater understanding of the role of BBB function could lead to new therapeutic approaches for diseases of the CNS that target the dynamic properties of brain endothelial cells.",

The measured values theoretically depend on various factors, which may differ between PET centres. This study explored the applicability of a database of (15)O-PET by examining between-centre and within-centre variation in values. Eleven PET centres participated in this multicentre study; seven used the steady-state inhalation method, one used build-up inhalation and three used bolus administration of C(15)O(2) (or H(2)(15)O) and (15)O(2). All used C(15)O for measurement of CBV. Subjects comprised 70 healthy volunteers (43 men and 27 women; mean age 51.8+/-15.1 years). Overall mean+/-SD values for cerebral cortical regions were: CBF=44.4+/-6.5 ml 100 ml(-1) min(-1); CBV=3.8+/-0.7 ml 100 ml(-1); OEF=0.44+/-0.06; CMRO(2)=3.3+/-0.5 ml 100 ml(-1) min(-1). Significant between-centre variation was observed in CBV, OEF and CMRO(2) by one-way analysis of variance. However, the overall inter-individual variation in CBF, CBV, OEF and CMRO(2) was acceptably small. Building a database of normal cerebral haemodynamics obtained by the(15)O-PET methods may be practicable.",

In addition, specific correlations between perfusion in the frontal lobes and performance on tests of frontal lobe ability were noted. These findings, while suggesting the importance of perfusion measures in determining clinical features of the disease, do not clearly define perfusion changes as primary, since similar findings have been seen when metabolism is studied. In a separate group of 5 AD patients and 16 controls, we used PET with the perfusion tracer HIPDM and examined cerebrovascular reactivity to carbon dioxide inhalation. We found that in multiple brain regions, including the temporal lobes, AD patients showed robust and significant increases in perfusion in response to carbon dioxide that did not differ from the response seen in the controls. Taken together, these results show that while perfusion changes are important in AD, they are not clearly either primary or limiting.",

Hexose transporter reduction in cerebral microvessels of Alzheimer subjects is relatively specific because other enzyme markers of brain endothelium were not significantly altered.

The cerebrovascular reactivity to changes of arterial PCO2 tension in the range of 24-70 mm Hg and to changes of MABP in the range of 55-150 mm Hg was studied in the rat brain after one episode of cortical spreading depression. Regional CBF (rCBF) was measured in the frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum of both hemispheres after the intravenous bolus injection of [14C]iodoantipyrine. rCBF decreased in the cortical regions to 69-73% of control values for 1 h after spreading depression in every single rat, but remained unchanged in the basal ganglia and cerebellum. CBF changed with alterations of arterial carbon dioxide tension in all brain regions. In control regions, CBF changed by 2.8-3.9% per mm Hg PaCO2 change, whereas in the spreading depression cortex, CBF changed by only 1.3-1.5%. The difference between control and spreading depression cortex was significant at p less than 0.001, indicating a reduced CO2 sensitivity of the cortical regions invaded by spreading depression. rCBF remained unchanged in all brain regions in the MABP range of 80-150 mm Hg, reflecting the intact autoregulatory function of the two sides, and at a MABP of less than 80 mm Hg, rCBF decreased in parallel in symmetrical regions. It is concluded that the hypoperfusion after spreading depression is due to a vasoconstrictor stimulus overriding the vasodilatory effect of acid pH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

These efforts have yielded several experimental models, some of which constitute AD models proper, others which specifically recapture the AD cerebrovascular pathology, characterized by anatomical alterations in brain vessel structure, as well as molecular changes within vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier. The following paper will present the elements of AD neurovascular dysfunction and review the in vitro and in vivo model systems that have served to deepen our understanding of it. It will also critically evaluate selected groups of compounds, the FDA-approved cholinesterase inhibitors and thiazolidinediones, for their ability to correct neurovascular dysfunction in AD patients and models. These and several others are emerging as compounds with pleiotropic actions that may positively impact dysfunctional cerebrovascular, glial, and neuronal networks in AD.",

Neocortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry in anesthetized APP(+) and APP(-) mice. MAP was elevated by intravenous infusion of phenylephrine and reduced by controlled exsanguination. In APP(-) mice, autoregulation was preserved. However, in APP(+) mice, autoregulation was markedly disrupted. The magnitude of the disruption was linearly related to brain A beta concentration. The failure of autoregulation was paralleled by impairment of the CBF response to endothelium-dependent vasodilators. Thus A beta disrupts a critical homeostatic mechanism of the cerebral circulation and renders CBF highly dependent on MAP. The resulting alterations in cerebral perfusion may play a role in the brain dysfunction and periventricular white-matter changes associated with Alzheimer's dementia.",

Maps of the water clearance, K1 into brain tissue, separated from the circulation by a measurably resistant blood-brain barrier (BBB), were generated by time-weighted integration. Depending on the validity of the assumptions underlying the two-compartment model presented here, the maps revealed a significant overestimation of the clearance of water when the vascular residue was ignored. Maps of Vo, the estimate of the apparent vascular distribution volume of tracer H2(15)O, clearly revealed major cerebral arteries.

Therefore, the use of a separately measured value for exogenous water clearance led to an error in the calculation of oxygen consumption. A new method presented in this paper eliminated the error by yielding oxygen consumption in a single oxygen study. We used time-weighted integration to estimate three parameters, including the unidirectional clearance from blood to brain (KO2(1)), the fractional clearance of the distribution volume in brain (kO2(2)), and the vascular volume correction (VO). We showed that the clearance of oxygen from blood to brain can be estimated with acceptable precision by this new approach, and that the new method yields a reliable measure of oxygen consumption.",

Impulse response functions estimated by Fourier transfer function analysis, a second-order mathematical model proposed by Tiecks, and the linear kernel of the Volterra-Wiener moving-average representation provided reconstructed velocity model responses, for the same segment of data, with significant correlations to CBFV recordings corresponding to r = 0.52 +/- 0.19, 0.53 +/- 0.16, and 0.67 +/- 0.12 (mean +/- SD), respectively. The correlation coefficient for the linear plus quadratic kernels was 0.82 +/- 0.08, significantly superior to that for the linear models (P &lt; 10(-6)). The supine linear impulse responses were also used to predict the velocity transient of a different baseline segment of data and of the thigh cuff velocity response with significant correlations. In both cases, the three linear methods provided equivalent model performances, but the correlation coefficient for the nonlinear model dropped to 0.26 +/- 0.25 for the baseline test set of data and to 0.21 +/- 0.42 for the thigh cuff data. Whereas it is possible to model dynamic cerebral autoregulation in humans with different linear methods, in the supine position a second-order nonlinear component contributes significantly to improve model accuracy for the same segment of data used to estimate model parameters, but it cannot be automatically extended to represent the nonlinear component of velocity responses of different segments of data or transient changes induced by the thigh cuff test.",

The primary objective of this study was to examine in man, how induced changes in global cerebral blood flow (gCBF) affected a regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) increase resulting from a neural activation task (opening of eyes). A secondary objective was to quantify how such induced changes in gCBF were distributed between representative regions of either predominantly grey matter or white matter. 2. Positron emission tomography with intravenous infusion of H2(15)O, was used to measure gCBF in six normal males. Concomitant measures of rCBF were obtained in three different regions of interest (ROI): a representative area of predominantly grey matter, a representative area of predominantly white matter and an area of visual cortex. 3. Cerebral blood flow was altered by establishing steady-state changes in PCO2 at a near constant ventilation of approximately 30 l min-1. The mean PET,CO2 (+/- S.D.) levels (mmHg) that resulted were: low, 21.8 +/- 1.8; normal, 39.8 +/- 1.0, and high, 54.8 +/- 1.2. The normal and high levels were obtained by adding appropriate amounts of CO2 to the inspirate. The corresponding mean gCBF levels across all six subjects with eyes closed were: low, 24.2 +/- 4.6; normal, 37.2 +/- 3.9 and high, 66.8 +/- 7.6 ml min-1 dl-1. 4. Blood flow in grey matter (insular cortex) and white matter (centrum semiovale) at normal levels of PCO2 averaged 56.8 +/- 10.1 and 20.3 +/- 3.4 ml min dl-1 respectively. As PCO2 rose, the increase in rCBF to grey matter was approximately three times greater than that to white matter. 5. An activation state of eyes open in a brightly lit room was compared to a baseline state of eyes closed in a darkened room at the three levels of PCO2 (and hence at three levels of gCBF). Over the whole gCBF range a significant (P = 0.028) effect of increasing rCBF in the visual cortex ROI was found in response to opening the eyes; the effect of this activation on rCBF was not significantly dependent (P = 0.34) on the PCO2 (and hence gCBF) level. The effect of the activation on the rCBF was apparently 'additive' to the rise of rCBF associated with PCO2-related gCBF increase. 6. The results confirm the need to normalize for changes in gCBF during studies of rCBF in response to an activation protocol. They also provide support for the use of an 'additive' model to achieve such normalization provided that other cortical areas behave in a similar manner to that of the visual cortex.",

Twelve healthy subjects (20 to 29 years), supine and seated, inhaled O2 air-mixtures (10% to 100%) with and without added 5% carbon dioxide and during hyperventilation. Two measures of frontal lobe oxygenation by NIRS (NIRO-200 and INVOS) were compared with capillary oxygen saturation (SCap) as calculated from the O2 content of brachial arterial and right internal jugular venous blood. At control SCap (78%+/-4%; mean+/-s.d.) was halfway between the arterial (98%+/-1%) and jugular venous oxygenation (SvO2; 61%+/-6%). Both NIRS devices monitored SCap (P&lt;0.001) within approximately 5% as SvO2 increased from 39%+/-5% to 79%+/-7% with an increase in the transcranial ultrasound Doppler determined middle cerebral artery flow velocity from 29+/-8 to 65+/-15 cm/sec. When SCap fell below approximately 70% with reduced flow and inspired oxygen tension, PMitoO2 decreased (P&lt;0.001) and brain lactate release increased concomitantly (P&lt;0.001). Handgrip strength correlated with the measured (NIRS) and calculated capillary oxygenation values as well as with PMitoO2 (r&gt;0.74; P&lt;0.05). These results show that NIRS is an adequate cerebral capillary-oxygenation-level-dependent (COLD) measure during manipulation of cerebral blood flow or inspired oxygen tension, or both, and suggest that motor performance correlates with the frontal lobe COLD signal.",

In the present study, we investigated morphological microvascular changes and capillary length density (CLD) in ten well-characterized AD patients compared to ten age-matched controls using virtual isotropic hemispheres. The CLD in the temporal cortex was increased by 33% in AD patients compared to controls (p=0.04), whereas CLD in the occipital cortex was unchanged. An increase of CLD was correlated to a decrease of cortical diameter in the temporal cortex (Pearson's r -0.62, p=0.003), suggesting that the increase in temporal CLD results from, or contributes to cortical atrophy. In the occipital cortex, more string vessels, probably remnants of degenerated capillaries, were observed in AD patients than in controls (p=0.004). An exploratory analysis suggests co-localization of A\u00ce\u02db and string vessels. Our data indicate that morphometric changes in the cortical capillary network occur in AD in a region-specific manner and may be related to cortical atrophy in the affected regions.",

    "abstxt": "The basal forebrain cholinergic complex comprising medial septum, horizontal and vertical diagonal band of Broca, and nucleus basalis of Meynert provides the mayor cholinergic projections to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The cholinergic neurons of this complex have been assumed to undergo moderate degenerative changes during aging, resulting in cholinergic hypofunction that has been related to the progressing memory deficits with aging. However, the previous view of significant cholinergic cell loss during aging has been challenged. Neuronal cell loss was found predominantly in pathological aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, while normal aging is accompanied by a gradual loss of cholinergic function caused by dendritic, synaptic, and axonal degeneration as well as a decrease in trophic support. As a consequence, decrements in gene expression, impairments in intracellular signaling, and cytoskeletal transport may mediate cholinergic cell atrophy finally leading to the known age-related functional decline in the brain including aging-associated cognitive impairments. However, in pathological situations associated with cognitive deficits, such as Parkinsons's disease, Down-syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, Jakob-Creutzfeld disease, Korsakoff's syndrome, traumatic brain injury, significant degenerations of basal forebrain cholinergic cells have been observed. In presenile (early onset), and in the advanced stages of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), a severe loss of cortical cholinergic innervation has extensively been documented. In contrast, in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a prodromal stage of AD), and early forms of AD, apparently no cholinergic neurodegeneration but a loss of cholinergic function occurs. In particular imbalances in the expression of NGF, its precursor proNGF, the high and low NGF receptors, trkA and p75NTR, respectively, changes in acetylcholine release, high-affinity choline uptake, as well as alterations in muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expression may contribute to the cholinergic dysfunction. These observations support the suggestion of a key role of the cholinergic system in the functional processes that lead to AD. Malfunction of the cholinergic system may be tackled pharmacologically by intervening in cholinergic as well as neurotrophic signaling cascades that have been shown to ameliorate the cholinergic deficit at early stages of the disease, and slow-down the progression. However, in contrast to many other, dementing disorders, in AD the cholinergic dysfunctions are accompanied by the occurrence of two major histopathological hallmarks such as \u03b2-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, provoking the question whether they play a particular role in inducing or mediating cholinergic dysfunction in AD. Indeed, there is abundant evidence that \u03b2-amyloid may trigger cholinergic dysfunction through action on \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, affecting NGF signaling, mediating tau phosphorylation, interacting with acetylcholinesterase, and specifically affecting the proteome in cholinergic neurons. Therefore, an early onset of an anti \u03b2-amyloid strategy may additionally be potential in preventing aging-associated cholinergic deficits and cognitive impairments.",

In seven successive activating conditions, subjects viewed a yellow-blue annular checkerboard reversing its contrast at frequencies of 0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 50 Hz. Stimulation began 4 minutes before and continued throughout the 3-minute dynamic scan. In the baseline condition, the subjects began fixating a cross hair 30 seconds before the scan and continued to do so for the duration of the 3-minute scan. At the start of each scan, the subjects inhaled 20 mCi of (15)O-O2 in a single breath. The CMR(O2) value was calculated using a two-compartment, weighted integration method. Normalized PET images were averaged across subjects and coregistered with the subjects' magnetic resonance imaging in stereotaxic space. Mean subtracted image volumes (activation minus baseline) of CMR(O2) then were obtained and converted to z statistic volumes. The authors found a statistically significant focal change of CMR(O2) in the striate cortex (x = 9; y = -89; z = -1) that reached a maximum at 4 Hz and dropped off sharply at higher stimulus frequencies.",

The model predicted a nonlinear relationship between stimulus-evoked changes of oxygen consumption and blood flow. The magnitude of the CMRO2/CBF ratio index (IO2) was used to indicate the degree of flow-metabolism coupling prevailing in specific areas of the brain during physiological stimulation. Therefore, the index provided a measure of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance contrast. To evaluate the changes of IO2 in response to visual stimulation, the model was applied to the effect of a changing flicker rate of a visual stimulus on the magnitudes of CBF, CMRO2, and oxygen diffusion capacity, in the human brain. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to measure the CBF and the CMRO2 in 12 healthy volunteers who viewed a cross-hair (baseline) or a yellow-blue annular checkerboard reversing at frequencies of 1, 4, or 8 Hz. The magnitude of CBF in the primary visual cortex increased as a function of the checkerboard reversal rate and reached a maximum at the frequency of 8 Hz (z=16.0), while the magnitude of CMRO2 reached a maximum at 4 Hz (z=4.0). Therefore, the calculated IO2 was lower at 8 Hz than at 1 and 4 Hz, in contrast to the oxidative metabolic rate that reached its maximum at 4 Hz. The model explained the increase of oxygen consumption as the combined effect of increased blood flow and increased oxygen diffusion capacity in the region of visual activation.",

In the left primary and supplementary motor cortices, CBF and CMRO(2) rose significantly during finger-thumb tapping. However, in the right putamen CBF did not rise, despite a significant increase in CMRO(2). We explain these observations by invoking a central command mechanism that regulates CBF in the putamen in anticipation of movement. By this mechanism, CBF rose in the putamen before the measurements of CBF and CMRO(2) while CMRO(2) rose when actual motion commenced.",

Aerobic glycolysis is present in the normal human brain at rest and increases locally during increased neuronal activity; yet its many biological functions have received scant attention because of a prevailing energy-centric focus on the role of glucose as substrate for oxidative phosphorylation. As an initial step in redressing this neglect, we measured the regional distribution of aerobic glycolysis with positron emission tomography in 33 neurologically normal young adults at rest. We show that the distribution of aerobic glycolysis in the brain is differentially present in previously well-described functional areas. In particular, aerobic glycolysis is significantly elevated in medial and lateral parietal and prefrontal cortices. In contrast, the cerebellum and medial temporal lobes have levels of aerobic glycolysis significantly below the brain mean. The levels of aerobic glycolysis are not strictly related to the levels of brain energy metabolism. For example, sensory cortices exhibit high metabolic rates for glucose and oxygen consumption but low rates of aerobic glycolysis. These striking regional variations in aerobic glycolysis in the normal human brain provide an opportunity to explore how brain systems differentially use the diverse cell biology of glucose in support of their functional specializations in health and disease.",

In 21 patients with mild to moderate AD and 20 age-matched controls, we investigated how oscillations in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and O(2)Hb are associated with spontaneous and induced oscillations in blood pressure (BP) at the very low (VLF = 0.05 Hz) and low frequencies (LF = 0.1 Hz). We applied spectral and transfer function analysis to quantify dynamic cerebral autoregulation and brain tissue oxygenation. In AD, cerebrovascular resistance was substantially higher (34%, AD vs. control: \u0394 = 0.69 (0.25) mm Hg/cm/second, p = 0.012) and the transmission of very low frequency (VLF) cerebral blood flow (CBF) oscillations into O(2)Hb differed, with increased phase lag and gain (\u0394 phase 0.32 [0.15] rad; \u0394 gain 0.049 [0.014] \u03bcmol/cm/second, p both &lt; 0.05).

Dynamic measurement of brain metabolism revealed that mild hypercapnia resulted in a suppression of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) by 13.4% \u00c2\u0105 2.3% (N=14) and, furthermore, the CMRO(2) change was proportional to the subject's end-tidal CO(2) (Et-CO(2)) change.

The extent of the reduction was more pronounced than similar indices obtained in visual-evoked fMRI, suggesting a selective suppression effect on resting-state neural activity. Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) studies comparing hypercapnia with normocapnia conditions showed a relative increase in low frequency power in the EEG spectra, suggesting that the brain is entering a low arousal state on CO(2) inhalation.",

    "abstxt": "Studies in transgenic mice overexpressing amyloid precursor protein (APP) demonstrate impaired autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) to changes in arterial pressure and suggest that cerebrovascular dysfunction may be critically important in the development of pathological Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given the relevance of such a finding for guiding hypertension treatment in the elderly, we assessed autoregulation in individuals with AD. Twenty persons aged 75\u00b16 years with very mild or mild symptomatic AD (Clinical Dementia Rating 0.5 or 1.0) underwent (15)O-positron emission tomography (PET) CBF measurements before and after mean arterial pressure (MAP) was lowered from 107\u00b113 to 92\u00b19 mm Hg with intravenous nicardipine; (11)C-PIB-PET imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were also obtained. There were no significant differences in mean CBF before and after MAP reduction in the bilateral hemispheres (-0.9\u00b15.2 mL per 100 g per minute, P=0.4, 95% confidence interval (CI)=-3.4 to 1.5), cortical borderzones (-1.9\u00b15.0 mL per 100 g per minute, P=0.10, 95% CI=-4.3 to 0.4), regions of T2W-MRI-defined leukoaraiosis (-0.3\u00b14.4 mL per 100 g per minute, P=0.85, 95% CI=-3.3 to 3.9), or regions of peak (11)C-PIB uptake (-2.5\u00b17.7 mL per 100 g per minute, P=0.30, 95% CI=-7.7 to 2.7). The absence of significant change in CBF with a 10 to 15 mm Hg reduction in MAP within the normal autoregulatory range demonstrates that there is neither a generalized nor local defect of autoregulation in AD.",
