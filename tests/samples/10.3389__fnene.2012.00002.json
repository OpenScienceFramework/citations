High affinity mitochondrial probes saturated in approximately 20% of mitochondria during histamine stimulation of HeLa cells, whereas a low affinity probe reported averaged peak values of 106 +/- 5 microm, indicating that Ca(2+) transients reach high levels in a fraction of mitochondria. In concurrent ER measurements, [Ca(2+)](ER) averaged 371 +/- 21 microm at rest and decreased to 133 +/- 14 microm and 59 +/- 5 microm upon stimulation with histamine and thapsigargin, respectively, indicating that substantial ER refilling occur during agonist stimulation. A larger ER depletion was observed when mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake was prevented by oligomycin and rotenone or when Ca(2+) efflux from mitochondria was blocked by CGP 37157, indicating that some of the Ca(2+) taken up by mitochondria is re-used for ER refilling. Accordingly, ER regions close to mitochondria released less Ca(2+) than ER regions lacking mitochondria. The ER heterogeneity was abolished by thapsigargin, oligomycin/rotenone, or CGP 37157, indicating that mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake locally modulate ER refilling. These observations indicate that some mitochondria are very close to the sites of Ca(2+) release and recycle a substantial portion of the captured Ca(2+) back to vicinal ER domains. The distance between the two organelles thus determines both the amplitude of mitochondrial Ca(2+) signals and the filling state of neighboring ER regions.",

Action potentials and postsynaptic effects of glutamate are predicted to consume much of the energy (47% and 34%, respectively), with the resting potential consuming a smaller amount (13%), and glutamate recycling using only 3%. Energy usage depends strongly on action potential rate--an increase in activity of 1 action potential/cortical neuron/s will raise oxygen consumption by 145 mL/100 g grey matter/h. The energy expended on signaling is a large fraction of the total energy used by the brain; this favors the use of energy efficient neural codes and wiring patterns. Our estimates of energy usage predict the use of distributed codes, with &lt;or=15% of neurons simultaneously active, to reduce energy consumption and allow greater computing power from a fixed number of neurons. Functional magnetic resonance imaging signals are likely to be dominated by changes in energy usage associated with synaptic currents and action potential propagation.",

Model predictions concluded that calreticulin interacts with the lumenal domain of the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-activated ATPase (SERCA) pump, altering pump affinity for Ca(2+) (K(1/2) switches from 247 to 431 nM) and hence generating Ca(2+) oscillations. Expression of calreticulin in the ER generated an average of six transient-decline oscillations during the Ca(2+) recovery phase, upon exposure to maximal levels of the agonist ATP. In contrast, normal cells produced a single Ca(2+) transient with few or no oscillations. By conditioning the model to experimental data, parameters for generation and decay of IP(3) and SERCA pump kinetics were determined. To elucidate the possible source of the oscillatory behavior three possible oscillators, 1) IP(3), 2) IP(3)R, and 3) SERCA pump, were investigated and parameters constrained by experimental data to produce the best candidate. Each of the three oscillators generated very good fits with experimental data. However, converting a normal exponential recovery to a transient-decline oscillator predicted that the SERCA pump is the most likely candidate for calreticulin-mediated Ca(2+) release, highlighting the role of this chaperone as a signal protein within the endoplasmic reticulum.",

The model has been used to perform simulated perturbation experiments that show that glycogen breakdown in astrocytes is significantly activated during sensory (tail pinch) stimulation. This mechanism provides an additional input of energy substrate during high consumption phases. By way of validation, data from the perfusion of 50 microM propranolol in the rat brain was compared with the model outputs. Propranolol affects the glucose dynamics during stimulation, and this was accurately reproduced in the model by a reduction in the glycogen breakdown in astrocytes. The model's predictive capacity was verified by using data from a sensory stimulation (restraint) that was not used for model calibration. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the model parameters, this showed that the control of energy metabolism and transport processes are critical in the metabolic behaviour of cerebral tissue.",

    "abstxt": "While a pathway for Ca2+ accumulation into mitochondria has long been established, its functional significance is only now becoming clear in relation to cell physiology and pathophysiology. The observation that mitochondria take up Ca2+ during physiological Ca2+ signalling in a variety of cell types leads to four questions: (i) 'What is the impact of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake on mitochondrial function?' (ii) 'What is the impact of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake on Ca2+ signalling?' (iii) 'What are the consequences of impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake for cell function?' and finally (iv) 'What are the consequences of pathological [Ca2+]c signalling for mitochondrial function?' These will be addressed in turn. Thus: (i) accumulation of Ca2+ into mitochondria regulates mitochondrial metabolism and causes a transient depolarisation of mitochondrial membrane potential. (ii) Mitochondria may act as a spatial Ca2+ buffer in many cells, regulating the local Ca2+ concentration in cellular microdomains. This process regulates processes dependent on local cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c), particularly the flux of Ca2+ through IP3-gated channels of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the channels mediating capacitative Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane. Consequently, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake plays a substantial role in shaping [Ca2+]c signals in many cell types. (iii) Impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake alters the spatiotemporal characteristics of cellular [Ca2+]c signalling and downregulates mitochondrial metabolism. (iv) Under pathological conditions of cellular [Ca2+]c overload, particularly in association with oxidative stress, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake may trigger pathological states that lead to cell death. In the model of glutamate excitotoxicity, microdomains of [Ca2+]c are apparently central, as the pathway to cell death seems to require the local activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), itself held by scaffolding proteins in close association with the NMDA receptor. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in combination with NO production triggers the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, culminating in delayed cell death.",

Two possible mechanisms were proposed: direct activation of the UCP proton transport mechanism by superoxide or its products and a cycle of hydroperoxyl radical entry coupled to UCP-catalyzed superoxide anion export. Here we provide evidence for the first mechanism and show that superoxide activates UCP2 in rat kidney mitochondria from the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane: (i) Exogenous superoxide inhibited matrix aconitase, showing that external superoxide entered the matrix. (ii) Superoxide-induced uncoupling was abolished by low concentrations of the mitochondrially targeted antioxidants 10-(6'-ubiquinonyl)decyltriphenylphosphonium (mitoQ) or 2-[2-(triphenylphosphonio)ethyl]-3,4-dihydro-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-ol bromide (mitoVit E), which are ubiquinone (Q) or tocopherol derivatives targeted to the matrix by covalent attachment to triphenylphosphonium cation. However, superoxide-induced uncoupling was not affected by similar concentrations of the nontargeted antioxidants Q(o), Q(1), decylubiquinone, vitamin E, or 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman 2-carboxylic acid (TROLOX) or of the mitochondrially targeted but redox-inactive analogs decyltriphenylphosphonium or 4-chlorobutyltriphenylphosphonium. Thus matrix superoxide appears to be necessary for activation of UCP2 by exogenous superoxide. (iii) When the reduced to oxidized ratio of mitoQ accumulated by mitochondria was increased by inhibiting cytochrome oxidase, it induced nucleotide-sensitive uncoupling that was not inhibited by external superoxide dismutase. Under these conditions quinols are known to produce superoxide, and because mitoQ is localized within the mitochondrial matrix this suggests that production of superoxide in the matrix was sufficient to activate UCP2. Furthermore, the superoxide did not need to be exported or to cycle across the inner membrane to cause uncoupling. We conclude that superoxide (or its products) exerts its uncoupling effect by activating the proton transport mechanism of uncoupling proteins at the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane.",

    "abstxt": "Cortical activity is the product of interactions among neuronal populations. Macroscopic electrophysiological phenomena are generated by these interactions. In principle, the mechanisms of these interactions afford constraints on biologically plausible models of electrophysiological responses. In other words, the macroscopic features of cortical activity can be modelled in terms of the microscopic behaviour of neurons. An evoked response potential (ERP) is the mean electrical potential measured from an electrode on the scalp, in response to some event. The purpose of this paper is to outline a population density approach to modelling ERPs. We propose a biologically plausible model of neuronal activity that enables the estimation of physiologically meaningful parameters from electrophysiological data. The model encompasses four basic characteristics of neuronal activity and organization: (i) neurons are dynamic units, (ii) driven by stochastic forces, (iii) organized into populations with similar biophysical properties and response characteristics and (iv) multiple populations interact to form functional networks. This leads to a formulation of population dynamics in terms of the Fokker-Planck equation. The solution of this equation is the temporal evolution of a probability density over state-space, representing the distribution of an ensemble of trajectories. Each trajectory corresponds to the changing state of a neuron. Measurements can be modelled by taking expectations over this density, e.g. mean membrane potential, firing rate or energy consumption per neuron. The key motivation behind our approach is that ERPs represent an average response over many neurons. This means it is sufficient to model the probability density over neurons, because this implicitly models their average state. Although the dynamics of each neuron can be highly stochastic, the dynamics of the density is not. This means we can use Bayesian inference and estimation tools that have already been established for deterministic systems. The potential importance of modelling density dynamics (as opposed to more conventional neural mass models) is that they include interactions among the moments of neuronal states (e.g. the mean depolarization may depend on the variance of synaptic currents through nonlinear mechanisms).Here, we formulate a population model, based on biologically informed model-neurons with spike-rate adaptation and synaptic dynamics. Neuronal sub-populations are coupled to form an observation model, with the aim of estimating and making inferences about coupling among sub-populations using real data. We approximate the time-dependent solution of the system using a bi-orthogonal set and first-order perturbation expansion. For didactic purposes, the model is developed first in the context of deterministic input, and then extended to include stochastic effects. The approach is demonstrated using synthetic data, where model parameters are identified using a Bayesian estimation scheme we have described previously.",

We found that the same neurons showing increased oxidative damage in Alzheimer's disease have a striking and significant increase in mtDNA and cytochrome oxidase. Surprisingly, much of the mtDNA and cytochrome oxidase is found in the neuronal cytoplasm and in the case of mtDNA, the vacuoles associated with lipofuscin.

However, the transcriptional components that are directly targeted by AMPK are still elusive. The peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) has emerged as a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis; furthermore, it has been shown that PGC-1alpha gene expression is induced by exercise and by chemical activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle. Using primary muscle cells and mice deficient in PGC-1alpha, we found that the effects of AMPK on gene expression of glucose transporter 4, mitochondrial genes, and PGC-1alpha itself are almost entirely dependent on the function of PGC-1alpha protein. Furthermore, AMPK phosphorylates PGC-1alpha directly both in vitro and in cells. These direct phosphorylations of the PGC-1alpha protein at threonine-177 and serine-538 are required for the PGC-1alpha-dependent induction of the PGC-1alpha promoter. These data indicate that AMPK phosphorylation of PGC-1alpha initiates many of the important gene regulatory functions of AMPK in skeletal muscle.",

In both HeLa cells and primary cultures of skeletal myotubes, stimulation with agonists evoking cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca(2+) signals caused increases in [ATP](m) and [ATP](c) that depended on two parameters: (i) the amplitude of the Ca(2+) rise in the mitochondrial matrix, and (ii) the availability of mitochondrial substrates. Moreover, the Ca(2+) elevation induced a long-lasting priming that persisted long after agonist washout and caused a major increase in [ATP](m) upon addition of oxidative substrates.

What properties of postsynaptic AMPA receptors are changed? Several lines of evidence argue against changes in AMPA-receptor kinetics. Neither LTD evoked in cultured granule-cell Purkinje cell (PC) pairs nor an LTD-like phenomenon evoked by phorbol ester application was associated with alterations in evoked AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory post-synaptic current (EPSC) or mEPSC kinetics. LTD produced by pairing glutamate pulses with depolarization was not altered by prior application of the desensitization-reducing compound cyclothiazide. Finally, rapid application of glutamate to lifted PCs revealed no significant alterations in AMPA-receptor kinetic properties after LTD induction. When this system was used to apply varying concentrations of glutamate, no alteration in AMPA-receptor glutamate affinity was seen after LTD induction. Finally, peak-scaled nonstationary fluctuation analysis was applied to estimate AMPA-receptor unitary conductance before and after LTD induction in a cultured cell pair, and this analysis too revealed no significant change. These results suggest that cerebellar LTD may be expressed solely as a reduction in the number of functional AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic density [Wang, Y.-T. &amp; Linden, D. J.

It is shown that inhibition in succinate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase by salicylate contributes substantially to the cumulative inhibition of the Krebs cycle by salicylates. Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation has little effect and coenzyme A consumption in salicylates transformation processes has an insignificant effect on the rate of substrate oxidation in the Krebs cycle.

The term &quot;uncoupling protein&quot; was originally used for UCP1, which is uniquely present in mitochondria of brown adipocytes, the thermogenic cells that maintain body temperature in small rodents. In these cells, UCP1 acts as a proton carrier activated by free fatty acids and creates a shunt between complexes of the respiratory chain and ATP synthase. Activation of UCP1 enhances respiration, and the uncoupling process results in a futile cycle and dissipation of oxidation energy as heat. UCP2 is ubiquitous and highly expressed in the lymphoid system, macrophages, and pancreatic islets. UCP3 is mainly expressed in skeletal muscles. In comparison to the established uncoupling and thermogenic activities of UCP1, UCP2 and UCP3 appear to be involved in the limitation of free radical levels in cells rather than in physiological uncoupling and thermogenesis. Moreover, UCP2 is a regulator of insulin secretion and UCP3 is involved in fatty acid metabolism.",

    "abstxt": "Permeation of ions from one electrolytic solution to another, through a protein channel, is a biological process of considerable importance. Permeation occurs on a time scale of micro- to milliseconds, far longer than the femtosecond time scales of atomic motion. Direct simulations of atomic dynamics are not yet possible for such long-time scales; thus, averaging is unavoidable. The question is what and how to average. In this paper, we average a Langevin model of ionic motion in a bulk solution and protein channel. The main result is a coupled system of averaged Poisson and Nernst-Planck equations (CPNP) involving conditional and unconditional charge densities and conditional potentials. The resulting NP equations contain the averaged force on a single ion, which is the sum of two components. The first component is the gradient of a conditional electric potential that is the solution of Poisson's equation with conditional and permanent charge densities and boundary conditions of the applied voltage. The second component is the self-induced force on an ion due to surface charges induced only by that ion at dielectric interfaces. The ion induces surface polarization charge that exerts a significant force on the ion itself, not present in earlier PNP equations. The proposed CPNP system is not complete, however, because the electric potential satisfies Poisson's equation with conditional charge densities, conditioned on the location of an ion, while the NP equations contain unconditional densities. The conditional densities are closely related to the well-studied pair-correlation functions of equilibrium statistical mechanics. We examine a specific closure relation, which on the one hand replaces the conditional charge densities by the unconditional ones in the Poisson equation, and on the other hand replaces the self-induced force in the NP equation by an effective self-induced force. This effective self-induced force is nearly zero in the baths but is approximately equal to the self-induced force in and near the channel. The charge densities in the NP equations are interpreted as time averages over long times of the motion of a quasiparticle that diffuses with the same diffusion coefficient as that of a real ion, but is driven by the averaged force. In this way, continuum equations with averaged charge densities and mean-fields can be used to describe permeation through a protein channel.",

The current study examined whether there is a disproportionate increase in glial cell density in the human frontal cortex in comparison with other anthropoid primate species (New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, and hominoids) to support greater metabolic demands. Among 18 species of anthropoids, humans displayed the greatest departure from allometric scaling expectations for the density of glia relative to neurons in layer II/III of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (area 9L). However, the human glia-neuron ratio in this prefrontal region did not differ significantly from allometric predictions based on brain size. Further analyses of glia-neuron ratios across frontal areas 4, 9L, 32, and 44 in a sample of humans, chimpanzees, and macaque monkeys showed that regions involved in specialized human cognitive functions, such as &quot;theory of mind&quot; (area 32) and language (area 44) have not evolved differentially higher requirements for metabolic support. Taken together, these findings suggest that greater metabolic consumption of human neocortical neurons relates to the energetic costs of maintaining expansive dendritic arbors and long-range projecting axons in the context of an enlarged brain.",

The removal of AMPA receptors requires protein kinase C phosphorylation of the GluR2 subunit within its carboxyl-terminal PSD-95/Discs Large/Zona Occludens-1 (PDZ) ligand and binding of the PDZ domain-containing protein, PICK1. The sequence of the GluR2 subunit is similar to that of the GluR3 and GluR4c subunits, which also contain PDZ ligands and protein kinase C consensus sites. Although GluR3 and GluR4c are also expressed in Purkinje cells, we have previously shown that cerebellar LTD is absent in GluR2(-/-) mice, suggesting that these subunits are unable to substitute functionally for GluR2. Here, we examine the apparent difference in the regulation of these AMPA receptor subunits by attempting to rescue LTD in GluR2(-/-) Purkinje cells with WT and mutant GluR2 and GluR3 subunits. Our results show that the selective interaction of the GluR2 subunit with the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor protein is required for synaptic, but not extrasynaptic, incorporation of AMPA receptors as well as for their competence to undergo LTD. In addition, perfusion of a synthetic peptide that acutely disrupts the interaction of GluR2 with N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor selectively depletes GluR2-containing receptors from synapses and occludes LTD. These findings demonstrate that interaction of AMPA receptors with N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor plays a critical role in incorporation of AMPA receptors into synapses and for their subsequent removal during cerebellar LTD.",

Recycling then leads to the docking and priming of the vesicles for another round of exo- and endocytosis. Recent studies have led to a better definition than previously available of how Ca2+ triggers exocytosis and how vesicles recycle. In particular, insight into how Munc18-1 collaborates with SNARE proteins in fusion, how the vesicular Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin 1 triggers fast release, and how the vesicular Rab3 protein regulates release by binding to the active zone proteins RIM1 alpha and RIM2 alpha has advanced our understanding of neurotransmitter release.

This near coincident firing of neurons could coordinate the multifaceted information of different features of a stimulus. The mechanisms of generating such synchrony are not clear. We simulated the activity of a population of excitatory and inhibitory neurons randomly interconnected into a recurrent network via synapses that display temporal dynamics in their transmission; surprisingly, we found a behavior of the network where action potential activity spontaneously self-organized to produce highly synchronous bursts involving virtually the entire network. These population bursts were also triggered by stimuli to the network in an all-or-none manner. We found that the particular intensities of the external stimulus to specific neurons were crucial to evoke population bursts. This topographic sensitivity therefore depends on the spectrum of basal discharge rates across the population and not on the anatomical individuality of the neurons, because this was random. These results suggest that networks in which neurons are even randomly interconnected via frequency-dependent synapses could exhibit a novel form of reflex response that is sensitive to the nature of the stimulus as well as the background spontaneous activity.",

However, very little is known about the consequences of LTD induction for subsequent signaling events in postsynaptic neurons. We have addressed this issue by examining homosynaptic LTD at the cerebellar climbing fiber (CF)-Purkinje cell (PC) synapse. This synapse is built for reliable and massive excitation: Activation of a single axon produces an unusually large alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor-mediated synaptic current, the depolarization of which drives a regenerative complex spike producing a large, widespread Ca(2+) transient in PC dendrites. Here we test whether CF LTD has an impact on dendritic, complex spike-evoked Ca(2+) signals by simultaneously performing long-term recordings of complex spikes and microfluorimetric Ca(2+) measurements in PC dendrites in rat cerebellar slices. Our data show that LTD of the CF excitatory postsynaptic current produces a reduction in both slow components of the complex spike waveform and complex spike-evoked dendritic Ca(2+) transients. This LTD of dendritic Ca(2+) signals may provide a neuroprotective mechanism and/or constitute &quot;heterosynaptic metaplasticity&quot; by reducing the probability for subsequent induction of those forms of use-dependent plasticity, which require CF-evoked Ca(2+) signals such as parallel fiber-PC LTD and interneuron-PC LTP.",

Herein we report cAMP-mediated LTP and long-term depression (LTD) at monosynaptic CA3-CA1 cell pairs in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. After bath application of the membrane-permeable cAMP analog adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Sp isomer (Sp-cAMPS), synaptic transmission was enhanced for at least 2 h. Consistent with previous findings, the late phase of LTP requires activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and protein synthesis. There is also an early phase of LTP induced by cAMP; the early phase depends on protein kinase A but, in contrast to the later phase, does not require protein synthesis. In addition, the cAMP-induced LTP is associated with a reduction of paired-pulse facilitation, suggesting that presynaptic modification may be involved. Furthermore, we found that Sp-cAMPS induced LTD in slices pretreated with picrotoxin, a gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor antagonist. This form of LTD depends on protein synthesis and protein phosphatase(s) and is accompanied by an increased ratio of failed synaptic transmission. These results suggest that GABA(A) receptors can modulate the effect of cAMP on synaptic transmission and thus determine the direction of synaptic plasticity.",

Faulty oxidative phosphorylation may be due to overall dysfunction of the respiratory chain, a heteromultimeric structure embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, or can be associated with single or multiple defects of the five complexes forming the respiratory chain itself. From the genetic standpoint, the respiratory chain is a unique structure of the inner mitochondrial membrane formed by means of the complementation of two separate genetic systems: the nuclear genome and the mitochondrial genome. The nuclear genome encodes the large majority of the protein subunits of the respiratory complexes and most of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and expression systems, whereas the mitochondrial genome encodes only 13 respiratory complex subunits, and some RNA components of the mitochondrial translational apparatus. Accordingly, mitochondrial disorders due to defects in OXPHOS include both mendelian-inherited and cytoplasmic-inherited diseases. This review describes human genetic diseases associated with mtDNA and nuclear DNA mutations leading to impaired OXPHOS.",

To examine the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an evolutionarily conserved fuel sensor, in mitochondrial biogenesis we studied transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative mutant of AMPK in muscle (DN-AMPK). Both DN-AMPK and WT mice were treated with beta-guanidinopropionic acid (GPA), a creatine analog, which led to similar reductions in the intramuscular ATPAMP ratio and phosphocreatine concentrations. In WT mice, GPA treatment resulted in activation of muscle AMPK and mitochondrial biogenesis. However, the same GPA treatment in DN-AMPK mice had no effect on AMPK activity or mitochondrial content. Furthermore, AMPK inactivation abrogated GPA-induced increases in the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha and calciumcalmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (both master regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis). These data demonstrate that by sensing the energy status of the muscle cell, AMPK is a critical regulator involved in initiating mitochondrial biogenesis.",
