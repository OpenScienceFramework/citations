Their protein products, Fos and Jun, form a heterodimeric complex that interacts with the DNA regulatory element known as the activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding site. Dimerization occurs via interaction between leucine zipper domains and serves to bring into proper juxtaposition a region in each protein that is rich in basic amino acids and that forms a DNA-binding domain. DNA binding of the Fos-Jun heterodimer was modulated by reduction-oxidation (redox) of a single conserved cysteine residue in the DNA-binding domains of the two proteins. Furthermore, a nuclear protein was identified that reduced Fos and Jun and stimulated DNA-binding activity in vitro. These results suggest that transcriptional activity mediated by AP-1 binding factors may be regulated by a redox mechanism.",

The authors used intracerebral microdialysis in conscious human subjects undergoing electrophysiologic evaluation for medically intractable epilepsy and measured ECF levels of glucose and lactate under basal conditions and during a hyperglycemia-hypoglycemia clamp study. Only measurements from nonepileptogenic areas were included. Under basal conditions, the authors found the metabolic milieu in the brain to be strikingly different from that in the circulation. In contrast to plasma, lactate levels in brain ECF were threefold higher than glucose. Results from complementary studies in rats were consistent with the human data. During the hyperglycemia-hypoglycemia clamp study the relationship between plasma and brain ECF levels of glucose remained similar, but changes in brain ECF glucose lagged approximately 30 minutes behind changes in plasma. The data demonstrate that the brain is exposed to substantially lower levels of glucose and higher levels of lactate than those in plasma; moreover, the brain appears to be a site of significant anaerobic glycolysis, raising the possibility that glucose-derived lactate is an important fuel for the brain.",

Recently, GPR109A, GPR109B and GPR81, which form a GPCR subfamily, have been deorphanized. The physiological ligands of these receptors are the ketone body 3-hydroxy-butyrate, the metabolite 2-hydroxy-propanoate (lactate) as well as the beta-oxidation intermediate 3-hydroxy-octanoate. Thus, this receptor subfamily is activated by hydroxy-carboxylic acid ligands which are intermediates of energy metabolism. All three receptors are predominantly expressed in adipocytes and mediate antilipolytic effects. In this article, we propose that the hydroxy-carboxylic acid structure of their endogenous ligands is the defining property of this receptor subfamily and that hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptors function as metabolic sensors which fine-tune the regulation of metabolic pathways.",

    "abstxt": "Intercellular monocarboxylate transport is important, particularly in tissues with high energy demands, such as brain and muscle. In skeletal muscle, it is well established that glycolytic fast twitch muscle fibers produce lactate, which is transported out of the cell through the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 4. Lactate is then taken up and oxidized by the oxidative slow twitch muscle fibers, which express MCT1. In the brain it is still questioned whether lactate produced in astrocytes is taken up and oxidized by neurons upon activation. Several studies have reported that astrocytes express MCT4, whereas neurons express MCT2. By comparing the localizations of MCTs in oxidative and glycolytic compartments I here give support to the idea that there is a lactate shuttle in the brain similar to that in muscle. This conclusion is based on studies in rodents using high resolution immunocytochemical methods at the light and electron microscopical levels.",

The distribution of MCT2 transporters within the individual postsynaptic densities mimicked that of the delta2 glutamate receptor, as shown by use of two different gold-particle sizes. The MCT2 distribution was also compared with the distributions of other monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1 and MCT4). The MCT1 immunolabeling was localized in the endothelial cells, while MCT4 immunogold particles were associated with glial profiles, including those abutting the synaptic cleft of the parallel fiber-spine synapses. The postsynaptic density (PSD) molecules identified so far can be divided into five classes: receptors, their anchoring molecules, molecules involved in signal transduction, ion channels, and attachment proteins. Here, we provide evidence that this list of molecules must now be extended to comprise an organic molecule transporter: the monocarboxylate transporter MCT2. The present data suggest that MCT2 has specific transport functions related to the synaptic cleft and that this transporter may allow an influx of lactate derived from perisynaptic glial processes. The expression of MCT2 in synaptic membranes may allow energy supply to be tuned to the excitatory drive.",

Previous evidence suggested that some MCT2 could be located in postsynaptic elements of glutamatergic synapses. Using post-embedding electron microscopic immunocytochemistry, it is demonstrated that MCT2 is present at postsynaptic density of asymmetric synapses, in the stratum radiatum of both rat hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions, as well as at parallel fibre-Purkinje cell synapses in mouse cerebellum. MCT2 levels were significantly lower at mossy fibre synapses on CA3 neurons, and MCT2 was almost absent from symmetric synapses on CA1 pyramidal cells. It could also be demonstrated using quantitative double-labeling immunogold cytochemistry that MCT2 and AMPA receptor GluR2/3 subunits have a similar postsynaptic distribution at asymmetric synapses with high levels expressed within the postsynaptic density. In addition, as for AMPA receptors, a significant proportion of MCT2 is located on vesicular membranes within the postsynaptic spine, forming an intracellular pool available for a putative postsynaptic endo/exocytotic trafficking at these excitatory synapses. Altogether, the data presented provide evidence for MCT2 expression in the postsynaptic density area at specific subsets of glutamatergic synapses, and also suggest that MCT2, like AMPA receptors, could undergo membrane trafficking.",

Using in vivo microdialysis, we show that ISF A\u03b2 concentrations in several brain regions of APP transgenic mice before plaque deposition were commensurate with the degree of subsequent plaque deposition and with the concentration of lactate, a marker of neuronal activity. Furthermore, unilateral vibrissal stimulation increased ISF A\u03b2, and unilateral vibrissal deprivation decreased ISF A\u03b2 and lactate, in contralateral barrel cortex.

State-dependent neuronal discharge activity of locus coeruleus neurons has long-suggested a role of this system in the induction of an alert waking state. More recent work supports this hypothesis, demonstrating robust wake-promoting actions of the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system. Norepinephrine enhances arousal, in part, via actions of beta- and alpha1-receptors located within multiple subcortical structures, including the general regions of the medial septal area and the medial preoptic areas. Recent anatomical studies suggest that arousal-enhancing actions of norepinephrine are not limited to the locus coeruleus system and likely include the A1 and A2 noradrenergic cell groups. Thus, noradrenergic modulation of arousal state involves multiple noradrenergic systems acting within multiple subcortical regions. Pharmacological studies indicate that the combined actions of these systems are necessary for the sustained maintenance of arousal levels associated with spontaneous waking. Enhanced arousal state is a prominent aspect of both stress and psychostimulant drug action and evidence indicates that noradrenergic systems likely play an important role in both stress-related and psychostimulant-induced arousal. These and other observations suggest that the dysregulation of noradrenergic neurotransmission could well contribute to the dysregulation of arousal associated with a variety of behavioral disorders including insomnia and stress-related disorders.",

    "abstxt": "It is well established that lactate can be used as an energy substrate by the brain by conversion to pyruvate and a subsequent oxidation in the mitochondria. Knowing the need for readily metabolizable substrates directly after ischemia and the protective effect of lactate after excitotoxicity, the aim of this study was to investigate whether lactate administration directly after ischemia could be neuroprotective. In vitro, the addition of 4 mmol/L L-lactate to the medium of rat organotypic hippocampal slices, directly after oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), protected against neuronal death, whereas a higher dose of 20 mmol/L was toxic. In vivo, after middle cerebral artery occlusion in the mouse, an intracerebroventricular injection of 2 microL of 100 mmol/L L-lactate, immediately after reperfusion, led to a significant decrease in lesion size, which was more pronounced in the striatum, and an improvement in neurologic outcome. A later injection 1 h after reperfusion did not reduce lesion size, but significantly improved neurologic outcome, which is an important point in the context of a potential clinical application. Therefore, a moderate increase in lactate after ischemia may be a therapeutic tool.",

The time courses of both the concentration and (13)C enrichment of blood glucose and lactate were determined. The data indicated the occurrence of [3-(13)C]lactate recycling through liver gluconeogenesis. The yield of glucose labeling was, however, reduced when using the glucose-containing infusate. After a 20-min or 1-h infusion, perchloric acid extracts of the brain tissue were prepared and subsequently analyzed by (13)C- and (1)H-observed/(13)C-edited NMR spectroscopy. The (13)C labeling of amino acids indicated that [3-(13)C]lactate was metabolized in the brain. Based on the alanine C3 enrichment, lactate contribution to brain metabolism amounted to 35% under the most favorable conditions used. By contrast with what happens with [1-(13)C]glucose metabolism, no difference in glutamine C2 and C3 labeling was evidenced, indicating that lactate was metabolized in a compartment deprived of pyruvate carboxylase activity. This result confirms, for the first time from an in vivo study, that lactate is more specifically a neuronal substrate.",

However, it has been recently proposed that lactate, generated from glucose via glycolysis, would be the oxidative substrate for neurons, particularly during neuronal activation, according to a mechanism called the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis (ANLSH). In that mechanism, glutamate released in the synaptic cleft during brain activation is taken up by astrocytes. This uptake, via the glutamate/Na(+) transporter, induces the entry of sodium, which is then excluded from the astrocytes via the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase. This exclusion consumes ATP, which stimulates glycolysis and thus lactate formation in astrocytes. This lactate is then transferred to neurons where it is utilized as oxidative substrate. This review tries to gather the recent evidences that support this hypothesis and presents the contribution of NMR to this matter.",

    "abstxt": "Once thought to be the consequence of oxygen lack in contracting skeletal muscle, the glycolytic product lactate is formed and utilized continuously in diverse cells under fully aerobic conditions. 'Cell-cell' and 'intracellular lactate shuttle' concepts describe the roles of lactate in delivery of oxidative and gluconeogenic substrates as well as in cell signalling. Examples of the cell-cell shuttles include lactate exchanges between between white-glycolytic and red-oxidative fibres within a working muscle bed, and between working skeletal muscle and heart, brain, liver and kidneys. Examples of intracellular lactate shuttles include lactate uptake by mitochondria and pyruvate for lactate exchange in peroxisomes. Lactate for pyruvate exchanges affect cell redox state, and by itself lactate is a ROS generator. In vivo, lactate is a preferred substrate and high blood lactate levels down-regulate the use of glucose and free fatty acids (FFA). As well, lactate binding may affect metabolic regulation, for instance binding to G-protein receptors in adipocytes inhibiting lipolysis, and thus decreasing plasma FFA availability. In vitro lactate accumulation upregulates expression of MCT1 and genes coding for other components of the mitochondrial reticulum in skeletal muscle. The mitochondrial reticulum in muscle and mitochondrial networks in other aerobic tissues function to establish concentration and proton gradients necessary for cells with high mitochondrial densities to oxidize lactate. The presence of lactate shuttles gives rise to the realization that glycolytic and oxidative pathways should be viewed as linked, as opposed to alternative, processes, because lactate, the product of one pathway, is the substrate for the other.",

    "abstxt": "We provide an integrative interpretation of neuroglial metabolic coupling including the presence of subcellular compartmentation of pyruvate and monocarboxylate recycling through the plasma membrane of both neurons and glial cells. The subcellular compartmentation of pyruvate allows neurons and astrocytes to select between glucose and lactate as alternative substrates, depending on their relative extracellular concentration and the operation of a redox switch. This mechanism is based on the inhibition of glycolysis at the level of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase by NAD(+) limitation, under sufficiently reduced cytosolic NAD(+)/NADH redox conditions. Lactate and pyruvate recycling through the plasma membrane allows the return to the extracellular medium of cytosolic monocarboxylates enabling their transcellular, reversible, exchange between neurons and astrocytes. Together, intracellular pyruvate compartmentation and monocarboxylate recycling result in an effective transcellular coupling between the cytosolic NAD(+)/NADH redox states of both neurons and glial cells. Following glutamatergic neurotransmission, increased glutamate uptake by the astrocytes is proposed to augment glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, balancing to a reduced cytosolic NAD(+)/NADH in the glia. Reducing equivalents are transferred then to the neuron resulting in a reduced neuronal NAD(+)/NADH redox state. This may eventually switch off neuronal glycolysis, favoring the oxidation of extracellular lactate in the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) equilibrium and in the neuronal tricarboxylic acid cycles. Finally, pyruvate derived from neuronal lactate oxidation, may return to the extracellular space and to the astrocyte, restoring the basal redox state and beginning a new loop of the lactate/pyruvate transcellular coupling cycle. Transcellular redox coupling operates through the plasma membrane transporters of monocarboxylates, similarly to the intracellular redox shuttles coupling the cytosolic and mitochondrial redox states through the transporters of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Finally, transcellular redox coupling mechanisms may couple glycolytic and oxidative zones in other heterogeneous tissues including muscle and tumors.",

At rest, brain energy is provided by a balanced oxidation of glucose as MR is close to 6, but activation provokes a 'surplus' uptake of glucose relative to that of O2. Whereas MR remains stable during light exercise, it is reduced by 30% to 40% when exercise becomes demanding. The MR integrates metabolism in brain areas stimulated by sensory input from skeletal muscle, the mental effort to exercise and control of exercising limbs. The MR decreases during prolonged exhaustive exercise where blood lactate remains low, but when vigorous exercise raises blood lactate, the brain takes up lactate in an amount similar to that of glucose. This lactate taken up by the brain is oxidised as it does not accumulate within the brain and such pronounced brain uptake of substrate occurs independently of plasma hormones. The 'surplus' of glucose equivalents taken up by the activated brain may reach approximately 10 mmol, that is, an amount compatible with the global glycogen level. It is suggested that a low MR predicts shortage of energy that ultimately limits motor activation and reflects a biologic background for 'central fatigue'.",

    "abstxt": "Central fatigue refers to circumstances in which strength appears to be limited by the ability of the central nervous system to recruit motoneurons. Central fatigue manifests when the effort to contract skeletal muscles is intense and, thus, is aggravated when exercise is performed under stress, whereas it becomes attenuated following training. Central fatigue has not been explained, but the cerebral metabolic response to intense exercise, as to other modalities of cerebral activation, is a reduction in its &quot;metabolic ratio&quot; (MR), i.e., the brain's uptake of oxygen relative to that of carbohydrate. At rest the MR is close to 6 but during intense whole-body exercise it decreases to less than 3, with the uptake of lactate becoming as important as that of glucose. It remains debated what underlies this apparent inability of the brain to oxidize the carbohydrate taken up, but it may approach approximately 10 mmol glucose equivalents. In the case of exercise, a concomitant uptake of ammonium for formation of amino acids may account for only approximately 10% of this &quot;extra&quot; carbohydrate taken up. Also, accumulation of intermediates in metabolic pathways and compartmentalization of metabolism between astrocytes and neurons are avenues that have to be explored. Depletion of glycogen stores and subsequent supercompensation during periods of low neuronal activity may not only play a role but also link brain metabolism to its function.",

Current models for lactate transport and metabolism involving cellular responses to excitatory neurotransmission are highly debated, owing, in part, to discordant results obtained in different experimental systems and conditions. Major conclusions drawn from tabular data summarizing results obtained in many laboratories are as follows: Glutamate-stimulated glycolysis is not an inherent property of all astrocyte cultures. Synaptosomes from the adult brain and many preparations of cultured neurons have high capacities to increase glucose transport, glycolysis, and glucose-supported respiration, and pathway rates are stimulated by glutamate and compounds that enhance metabolic demand. Lactate accumulation in activated tissue is a minor fraction of glucose metabolized and does not reflect pathway fluxes. Brain activation in subjects with low plasma lactate causes outward, brain-to-blood lactate gradients, and lactate is quickly released in substantial amounts. Lactate utilization by the adult brain increases during lactate infusions and strenuous exercise that markedly increase blood lactate levels. Lactate can be an 'opportunistic', glucose-sparing substrate when present in high amounts, but most evidence supports glucose as the major fuel for normal, activated brain.",

In this report we provide modeling evidence that cyclic physiological activation of astroglial cells produces similar BOLD oscillations through a mechanism mediated by intracellular Ca(2+) signaling. Specifically, neurotransmission induces pulses of Ca(2+) concentration in astrocytes, resulting in increased cerebral perfusion and neuroactive transmitter release by these cells (i.e., gliotransmission), which in turn stimulates neuronal activity. Noticeably, the level of neuron-astrocyte cross talk regulates the periodic behavior of the Ca(2+) wave-induced BOLD fluctuations.

We found that glycogen synthesis and degradation affects the relative amount of glucose taken up by neurons versus astrocytes. Under conditions of 175:115\u2009mmol/L (\u223c1.5:1) neuronal versus astrocytic activation-induced Na(+) influx ratio, \u223c12% of astrocytic glycogen is mobilized. This results in the rapid increase of intracellular glucose-6-phosphate level on stimulation and nearly 40% mean decrease of glucose flow through hexokinase (HK) in astrocytes via product inhibition. The suppression of astrocytic glucose phosphorylation, in turn, favors the channeling of glucose from interstitium to nearby activated neurons, without a critical effect on the concurrent intercellular lactate trafficking. Under conditions of increased neuronal versus astrocytic activation-induced Na(+) influx ratio to 190:65\u2009mmol/L (\u223c3:1), glycogen is not significantly degraded and blood glucose is primarily taken up by neurons. These results support a role for astrocytic glycogen in preserving extracellular glucose for neuronal utilization, rather than providing lactate to neurons as is commonly accepted by the current 'thinking paradigm'. This might be critical in subcellular domains during functional conditions associated with fast energetic demands.",

Six healthy active men (26 +/- 2 yr, 82 +/- 2 kg, 50.7 +/- 2.1 ml.kg(-1).min(-1)) were studied on five occasions after an overnight fast. Plasma concentrations of NE and Epi were determined during 90 min of rest and 90 min of exercise at 55% of peak O2 consumption (VO2 peak) two times with exogenous lactate infusion (lactate clamp, LC) and two times without LC (CON). The blood lactate profile ( approximately 4 mM) of a preliminary trial at 65% VO2 peak (65%) was matched during the subsequent LC trials. In resting men, plasma NE concentration was not different between trials, but during exercise all conditions were different with 65% &gt; CON &gt; LC (65%: 2,115 +/- 166 pg/ml, CON: 1,573 +/- 153 pg/ml, LC: 930 +/- 174 pg/ml, P &lt; 0.05).

In current models of hyaluronan catabolism, it is tethered to cell surfaces by CD44 in caveolin-enriched invaginations. It is cleaved to 20-kDa fragments by Hyal-2 on the plasma membrane, endocytosed, and delivered ultimately to lysosomes, and further digested by Hyal-1. Sequence analyses of promoter regions of genes for CD44, caveolin-1, Hyal-1, and -2 revealed multiple AP-1 and ets-1 response elements. To test their relevance, RNA from lactate-treated fibroblasts was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Increased transcripts of c-fos, c-jun, c-ets, Hyal-1, -2, CD44, and caveolin-1 mRNAs were observed. We have thus identified lactate-activated genes important in the wound healing responses.

Our mapping of the central monoamine neurons was continued and further established with tyrosine hydroxylase, dopa decarboxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunohistochemistry in collaboration with Menek Goldstein and Tomas H\u0e23\u0e16kfelt. During recent years an evolutionary constraint in the nuclear parcellation of the DA, NA and 5-HT neurons was demonstrated in the order Rodentia and other mammals. The abundant existence of global monoamine varicose nerve terminal networks synthesizing, storing and releasing monoamines in various parts of the CNS, including the release of DA by tubero-infundibular DA neurons as a prolactin inhibitory factor from the external layer of the median eminence into the portal vessels and the appearance of extraneuronal DA fluorescence after, e.g., treatment with amphetamine in nialamide pretreated rats (Falck-Hillarp technique) were also remarkable observations. These observations and others like the discovery of transmitter-receptor mismatches opened up the possibility that monoamines were modulating the wired brain, built up mainly by glutamate and GABA neurons, through diffusion and flow in the extracellular fluid of the extracellular space and in the CSF. This transmission also involved long-distance channels along myelinated fibers and blood vessels and was called volume transmission (VT). The extracellular space (ECS), filled with a 3D matrix, plays a fundamental role in this communication. Energy gradients for signal migration in the ECS are produced via concentration, temperature and pressure gradients, the latter two allowing a flow of the ECF and CSF carrying the VT signals. The differential properties of the wiring transmission (WT) and VT circuits and communication channels will be discussed as well as the role of neurosteroids and oxytocin receptors in volume transmission leading to a new understanding of the integrative actions of neuronal-glial networks. The role of tunneling nanotubes with mitochondrial transfer in CNS inter alia as part of neuron-glia interactions will also be introduced representing a novel type of wiring transmission. The impact of the technicolour approach to the connectome for the future characterization of the wired networks of the brain is emphasized.",

GPR81 expression is highly enriched and specific in adipocytes. However, the function and signaling properties of GPR81 are unknown because of the lack of natural or synthetic ligands. Using chimeric G proteins that convert Gi-coupled receptors to Gq-mediated inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation, we show that GPR81 can constitutively increase IP accumulation in HEK293 cells and suggest that GPR81 couples to the Gi signaling pathway. We also constructed a chimeric receptor that expresses the extracellular domains of cysteinyl leukotriene 2 receptor (CysLT2R) and the intracellular domains of GPR81. We show that the CysLT2R ligand, leukotriene D(4) (LTD4), is able to activate this chimeric receptor through activation of the Gi pathway. In addition, LTD4 is able to inhibit lipolysis in adipocytes expressing this chimeric receptor. These results suggest that GPR81 couples to the Gi signaling pathway and that activation of the receptor may regulate adipocyte function and metabolism. Hence, targeting GPR81 may lead to the development of a novel and effective therapy for dyslipidemia and a better side effect profile than nicotinic acid.",

A common explanation of the mismatched CBF and oxygen consumption (CMR(O(2))) during neuronal excitation holds that blood flow rises more than oxygen consumption to compensate for an absent oxygen reserve in brain mitochondria. The claim conversely implies that oxygen consumption must decline when blood flow declines. As the prevailing rate of reaction of oxygen with cytochrome c oxidase is linked to the tension of oxygen, the claim fails to explain how oxygen consumption is maintained during moderate reductions of CBF imposed by hyperventilation (hypocapnia) or cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. To resolve this contradiction, we extended the previously published oxygen delivery model with a term allowing for the adjustment of the affinity of cytochrome c oxidase to a prevailing oxygen tension. The extended model predicted constant oxygen consumption at moderately reduced blood flow. We determined the change of affinity of cytochrome c oxidase in the extended model by measuring CBF in seven, and CMR(O(2)) in five, young healthy volunteers before and during COX inhibition with indomethacin. The average CBF declined 35%, while neither regional nor average CMR(O(2)) changed significantly. The adjustment of cytochrome c oxidase affinity to the declining oxygen delivery could be ascribed to a hypothetical factor with several properties in common with nitric oxide.",

We simultaneously estimated the activity of the decarboxylating enzyme and the amino acid transport. In the striatum of patients, we found the L-DOPA decarboxylase activity to be reduced in the head of the caudate nucleus and the putamen.

    "abstxt": "The regulation of brain energy metabolism during neuronal activation is poorly understood. Specifically, the extent to which oxidative metabolism rather than glycolysis supplies the additional ATP necessary to sustain neuronal activation is in doubt. A recent hypothesis claims that astrocytes generate lactate with the muscle-type lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozyme LD 5. Lactate from astrocytes then undergoes oxidation in neurons after reconversion to pyruvate by the LDH subtype LD 1. On the basis of this hypothesis, the authors predicted that the time course of an excitatory increase of the oxidative metabolism of brain tissue must depend on the degree to which astrocytes provide neurons with pyruvate in the form of lactate. From the known properties of the LDH subtypes, the authors predicted two time courses for the changes of oxygen consumption in response to neuronal stimulation: one reflecting the properties of the neuronal LDH subtype LD 1, and the other reflecting the astrocytic LDH subtype LD 5. Measuring oxygen consumption (CMR O2 ) with positron emission tomography, the authors demonstrated increased CMR O2 during sustained stimulation of visual cortex with a complex stimulus. The CMR O2 increased 20.5% after 3 minutes and 27.5% after 8 minutes of stimulation, consistent with a steady-state oxygen-glucose metabolism ratio of 5.3, which is closest to the index predicted for the LD 1 subtype. The index is equal to the oxygen-glucose metabolism ratio of 5.5 calculated at baseline, indicating that pyruvate is converted to lactate in a cellular compartment with an LDH reaction closest to that of LD 1, whether at rest or during stimulation of the visual cortex with the current stimulus. The findings are consistent with a claim that neurons increase their oxidative metabolism in parallel with an increase of pyruvate, the latter generated by neuronal rather than astrocytic glycolysis.",

    "sponsors": [], 
    "abstxt": "There is evidence that the metabolic responses to afferent and efferent nervous activity are dissociated at sites of neuronal excitation in brain. Whether efferent activity follows afferent activity depends on the responsiveness of postsynaptic neurons, which in turn depends on the summation of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. The afferent activity excites the presynaptic terminals and astrocytes, whereas the efferent activity arises from excitation of the dendrites of projection neurons. Measurements in vivo indicate that primary stimulation, elicited by simple stimuli, gives rise to limited increases of energy metabolism associated with afferent activity. Reports show that a major consequence of afferent activity, in addition to the release of excitatory neurotransmitters from presynaptic terminals and the import of glutamate by astrocytes, is the establishment of rates of blood flow commensurate with increased rates of oxidative energy metabolism associated with efferent activity projecting from the site of activation. Increased flow rates overcome the inherent diffusion limitation of oxygen delivery, while increased rates of glycolysis elevate tissue pyruvate contents, to which oxygen consumption rates are matched. In vivo, neurons in the baseline condition sustain no net import of pyruvate or lactate, and the reported changes of metabolism subserving afferent and efferent activity are additive rather than linked by significant additional transfer of pyruvate or lactate from astrocytes. The dissociation of blood flow changes from efferent activity weakens the identification of functional states by changes of blood flow alone. It raises the possibility that uncoupling of flow from oxidative metabolism occurs at sites of low efferent activity, such that dissociations of flow and glycolysis from oxygen consumption signify imbalances of afferent and efferent activity.",

Here we show that the ability of astrocytes to induce vasodilations over vasoconstrictions relies on the metabolic state of the rat brain tissue. When oxygen availability is lowered and astrocyte calcium concentration is elevated, astrocyte glycolysis and lactate release are maximized. External lactate attenuates transporter-mediated uptake from the extracellular space of prostaglandin E(2), leading to accumulation and subsequent vasodilation. In conditions of low oxygen concentration extracellular adenosine also increases, which blocks astrocyte-mediated constriction, facilitating dilation. These data reveal the role of metabolic substrates in regulating brain blood flow and provide a mechanism for differential astrocyte control over cerebrovascular diameter during different states of brain activation.",

Awake mice received [3-13C]lactate or [1-13C]glucose intravenously, and brain and blood extracts were analyzed by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The cerebral uptake and metabolism of [3-13C]lactate was 50% that of [1-13C]glucose. [3-13C]Lactate was almost exclusively metabolized by neurons and hardly at all by glia, as revealed by the 13C labeling of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamine. Injection of [3-13C]lactate led to extensive formation of [2-13C]lactate, which was not seen with [1-13C]glucose, nor has it been seen in previous studies with [2-13C]acetate. This formation probably reflected reversible carboxylation of [3-13C]pyruvate to malate and equilibration with fumarate, because inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase with nitropropionic acid did not block it. Of the [3-13C]lactate that reached the brain, 20% underwent this reaction, which probably involved neuronal mitochondrial malic enzyme. The activities of mitochondrial malic enzyme, fumarase, and lactate dehydrogenase were high enough to account for the formation of [2-13C]lactate in neurons. Neuronal pyruvate carboxylation was confirmed by the higher specific activity of glutamate than of glutamine after intrastriatal injection of [1-14C]pyruvate into anesthetized mice. This procedure also demonstrated equilibration of malate, formed through pyruvate carboxylation, with fumarate. The demonstration of neuronal pyruvate carboxylation demands reconsideration of the metabolic interrelationship between neurons and glia.",

The near-equilibrium between free cytosolic NADH/NAD(+) and lactate/pyruvate ratios established by lactate dehydrogenase predicts that transfer of additional electrons and protons from injected lactate to NAD(+) will augment the elevated blood flows in stimulated retina and cortex, whereas transfer of electrons and protons from NADH to injected pyruvate will attenuate the elevated flows. These predictions were tested and confirmed in rats. Increased flows evoked by stimulation also were prevented by inhibition of nitric oxide synthase. These findings support an important role for cytosolic free NADH in fueling a signaling cascade that increases *NO production, which augments blood flow in photostimulated retina and visual cortex.",

Warburg and co-workers showed in the 1920s that, under aerobic conditions, tumour tissues metabolize approximately tenfold more glucose to lactate in a given time than normal tissues, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. However, this increase in aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells is often erroneously thought to occur instead of mitochondrial respiration and has been misinterpreted as evidence for damage to respiration instead of damage to the regulation of glycolysis. In fact, many cancers exhibit the Warburg effect while retaining mitochondrial respiration. We re-examine Warburg's observations in relation to the current concepts of cancer metabolism as being intimately linked to alterations of mitochondrial DNA, oncogenes and tumour suppressors, and thus readily exploitable for cancer therapy.",

Today cerebral microdialysis is an established, commercially available clinical tool that is focused primarily on markers of cerebral energy metabolism (glucose, lactate, and pyruvate) and cell damage (glycerol), and neurotransmitters (glutamate). Although the brain comprises only 2% of body weight, it consumes 20% of total body energy. Consequently, the ability to monitor cerebral metabolism can provide significant insights during clinical care. Measurements of lactate, pyruvate, and glucose give information about the comparative contributions of aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms to brain energy. The lactate/pyruvate ratio reflects cytoplasmic redox state and thus provides information about tissue oxygenation. An elevated lactate pyruvate ratio (&gt;40) frequently is interpreted as a sign of cerebral hypoxia or ischemia. However, several other factors may contribute to an elevated LPR. This article reviews potential non-hypoxic/ischemic causes of an increased LPR.",

Peripheral (short-term overtraining, STO) or peripheral and central fatigue may result (long-term overtraining, LTO). STO lasting a few days up to 2 wk is termed overreaching. STO is associated with fatigue, reduction, or stagnation of the 4 LT performance capacity (performance at 4 mmol lactate or comparable criterion), reduction of maximum performance capacity, and brief competitive incompetence. Recovery is achieved within days, so the prognosis is favorable. LTO lasting weeks or months causes overtraining syndrome or staleness. The symptomatology associated with overtraining syndrome has changed over the last 50 yr from excitation and restlessness (so-called sympathetic form) to phlegmatic behavior and inhibition (so-called parasympathetic form). Increased volume of training at a high-intensity level is likely the culprit. The parasympathetic form of overtraining syndrome dominates in endurance sports. Accumulation of exercise and nonexercise fatigue, stagnation, or reduction of the 4 LT performance capacity, reduction in maximum performance capacity, mood state disturbances, muscle soreness/stiffness, and long-term competitive incompetence can be expected. Complete recovery requires weeks and months, so the prognosis is unfavorable. Other optional or further confirmation requiring findings include changes in blood chemistry variables, hormone levels, and nocturnal urinary catecholamine excretion. Based on the findings reported, recommendations for training monitoring can be made, but their relevance in the practice must still be clarified.",

Lactate is also a key source of energy and an important metabolic substrate, and it has also been hypothesized to be a signaling molecule directing metabolic activity. Here we show that GPR81, an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor highly expressed in fat, is in fact a sensor for lactate. Lactate activates GPR81 in its physiological concentration range of 1-20 mM and suppresses lipolysis in mouse, rat, and human adipocytes as well as in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. Adipocytes from GPR81-deficient mice lack an antilipolytic response to lactate but are responsive to other antilipolytic agents. Lactate specifically induces internalization of GPR81 after receptor activation. Site-directed mutagenesis of GPR81 coupled with homology modeling demonstrates that classically conserved key residues in the transmembrane binding domains are responsible for interacting with lactate. Our results indicate that lactate suppresses lipolysis in adipose tissue through a direct activation of GPR81. GPR81 may thus be an attractive target for the treatment of dyslipidemia and other metabolic disorders.",

This has been interpreted as evidence that brain work is supported mainly by energy derived from anaerobic glycolysis. To determine if lactate production accounts for the &quot;excess&quot; glucose consumption, cerebral arteriovenous differences were measured in conscious rats before, during, and 15 minutes after sensory stimulation; the brains were rapidly frozen in situ immediately after completion of blood sampling and assayed for metabolite levels. The molar O2/glucose uptake ratio fell from 6.1+/-1.1 (mean+/-SD) before stimulation to 5.0+/-1.1 during activation (P&lt;0.01); lactate efflux from brain to blood was detectable at rest but not during stimulation. By 15 minutes after activation, O2 and lactate arteriovenous differences normalized, whereas that for glucose fell, causing the O2/glucose ratio to rise above preactivation levels to 7.7+/-2.6 (P&lt;0.01). Brain glucose levels remained stable through all stages of activity. Brain lactate levels nearly doubled during stimulation but normalized within 15 minutes of recovery. Brain glycogen content fell during activation and declined further during recovery. These results indicate that brain glucose metabolism is not in a steady state during and shortly after activation. Furthermore, efflux from and increased content of lactate in the brain tissue accounted for less than 54% of the &quot;excess&quot; glucose used during stimulation, indicating that a shift to anaerobic glycolysis does not fully explain the disproportionately greater increases in CMRglc above that of CMRO2 in functionally activated brain. These results also suggest that the apparent dissociation between glucose utilization and O2 consumption during functional activation reflects only a temporal displacement; during activation, glycolysis increases more than oxidative metabolism, leading to accumulation of products in intermediary metabolic pools that are subsequently consumed and oxidized during recovery.",

    "abstxt": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS), natural by-products of aerobic respiration, are important cell signaling molecules, which left unchecked can severely impair cellular functions and induce cell death. Hence, cells have developed a series of systems to keep ROS in the nontoxic range. Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) 1-3 are mitochondrial anion carrier proteins that are purported to play important roles in minimizing ROS emission from the electron transport chain. The function of UCP1 in this regard is highly contentious. However, UCPs 2 and 3 are generally thought to be activated by ROS or ROS by-products to induce proton leak, thus providing a negative feedback loop for mitochondrial ROS production. In our laboratory, we have not only confirmed that ROS activate UCP2 and UCP3, but also demonstrated that UCP2 and UCP3 are controlled by covalent modification by glutathione. Furthermore, the reversible glutathionylation is required to activate/inhibit UCP2 and UCP3, but not UCP1. Hence, our findings are consistent with the notion that UCPs 2 and 3 are acutely activated by ROS, which then directly modulate the glutathionylation status of the UCP to decrease ROS emission and participate in cell signaling mechanisms.",

Activity-dependent rises in CMRO(2) fluctuate with ATP turnover due to ion pumping. In vitro studies suggest that increases in cytosolic Ca(2+) stimulate oxidative metabolism via mitochondrial signaling, but whether this also occurs in the intact brain is unknown. Here we applied a pharmacological approach to dissect the effects of ionic currents and cytosolic Ca(2+) rises of neuronal origin on activity-dependent rises in CMRO(2). We used two-photon microscopy and current source density analysis to study real-time Ca(2+) dynamics and transmembrane ionic currents in relation to CMRO(2) in the mouse cerebellar cortex in vivo. We report a direct correlation between CMRO(2) and summed (i.e., the sum of excitatory, negative currents during the whole stimulation period) field EPSCs (\u2211fEPSCs) in Purkinje cells (PCs) in response to stimulation of the climbing fiber (CF) pathway. Blocking stimulus-evoked rises in cytosolic Ca(2+) in PCs with the P/Q-type channel blocker \u03c9-agatoxin-IVA (\u03c9-AGA), or the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol, did not lead to a time-locked reduction in CMRO(2), and excitatory synaptic or action potential currents. During stimulation, neither \u03c9-AGA or (\u03bc-oxo)-bis-(trans-formatotetramine-ruthenium) (Ru360), a mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter inhibitor, affected the ratio of CMRO(2) to fEPSCs or evoked local field potentials. However, baseline CBF and CMRO(2) decreased gradually with Ru360. Our data suggest that in vivo activity-dependent rises in CMRO(2) are correlated with synaptic currents and postsynaptic spiking in PCs. Our study did not reveal a unique role of neuronal cytosolic Ca(2+) signals in controlling CMRO(2) increases during CF stimulation.",

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozymes in cytosol from primary cultures of neurons and astrocytes, and freshly isolated synaptic terminals (synaptosomes) from adult rat brain were separated by electrophoresis, visualized with an activity-based stain, and quantified. The activity and kinetics of LDH were determined in the same preparations. In synaptosomes, the forward reaction (pyruvate + NADH + H(+ )--&gt; lactate + NAD(+)), which had a V (max) of 1,163 micromol/min/mg protein was 62% of the rate in astrocyte cytoplasm. In contrast, the reverse reaction (lactate + NAD(+ )--&gt; pyruvate + NADH + H(+)), which had a V (max) of 268 micromol/min/mg protein was 237% of the rate in astrocytes. Although the relative distribution was different, all five isozymes of LDH were present in synaptosomes and primary cultures of cortical neurons and astrocytes from rat brain. LDH1 was 14.1% of the isozyme in synaptic terminals, but only 2.6% and 2.4% in neurons and astrocytes, respectively. LDH5 was considerably lower in synaptic terminals than in neurons and astrocytes, representing 20.4%, 37.3% and 34.8% of the isozyme in these preparations, respectively. The distribution of LDH isozymes in primary cultures of cortical neurons does not directly reflect the kinetics of LDH and the capacity for lactate oxidation. However, the kinetics of LDH in brain are consistent with the possible release of lactate by astrocytes and oxidative use of lactate for energy in synaptic terminals.",

Although glutamate mediates synaptically confined point-to-point transmission, it has been suggested that under certain conditions glutamate may escape from the synaptic cleft (glutamate spillover), accumulate in the extrasynaptic space, and mediate volume transmission to regulate important brain functions. However, the inability to directly measure glutamate dynamics around active synapses has limited our understanding of glutamatergic volume transmission. The recent development of a family of fluorescent glutamate indicators has enabled the visualization of extrasynaptic glutamate dynamics in brain tissues. In this topical review, we examine glutamate as a volume transmitter based on novel results of glutamate imaging in the brain.",

However, during functional activation, CBF and glucose metabolism remain coupled as they increase in proportion, whereas oxygen metabolism only increases to a minor degree-the so-called uncoupling of CBF and oxidative metabolism. Several studies have dealt with these issues, and theories have been forwarded regarding the underlying mechanisms. Some reports have speculated about the existence of a potentially deficient oxygen supply to the tissue most distant from the capillaries, whereas other studies point to a shift toward a higher degree of non-oxidative glucose consumption during activation. In this review, we argue that the key mechanism responsible for the regional CBF (rCBF) increase during functional activation is a tight coupling between rCBF and glucose metabolism. We assert that uncoupling of rCBF and oxidative metabolism is a consequence of a less pronounced increase in oxygen consumption. On the basis of earlier studies, we take into consideration the functional recruitment of capillaries and attempt to accommodate the cerebral tissue's increased demand for glucose supply during neural activation with recent evidence supporting a key function for astrocytes in rCBF regulation.",

Glucose consumption was determined in neuronal cultures incubated in Krebs ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB) containing 0.25-5 mM glucose, in the presence and absence of 5 mM lactate as an alternative substrate. Lactate consumption was measured in neuronal cultures incubated with 1-15 mM lactate, in the presence and absence of 1 mM glucose. In both cases, the alternative substrate increased the K(m) (mM) values for glucose consumption (from 2.2 +/- 0.2 to 3.6 +/- 0.1) or lactate consumption (from 7.8 +/- 0.1 to 8.5 +/- 0.1) without significant changes on the corresponding V(max). This is consistent with a competitive inhibition between the simultaneous consumption of glucose and lactate. When cultures of neurons or astrocytes were incubated with increasing lactate concentrations 1-20 mM, pyruvate production was observed with K(m) (mM) and V(max) (nmol/mg/h) values of 1.0 +/- 0.1 and 109 +/- 4 in neurons, or 0.28 +/- 0.1 and 342 +/- 54 in astrocytes. Thus, astrocytes or neurons are able to return to the incubation medium as pyruvate, a significant part of the lactate consumed. Present results support the reversible exchange of reducing equivalents between neurons and astrocytes in the form of lactate or pyruvate. Monocarboxylate exchange is envisioned to operate under near equilibrium, with the transcellular flux directed thermodynamically toward the more oxidized intracellular redox environment.",

This study evaluated whether a reduction in the cerebral oxygen-to-carbohydrate index (OCI) and in the cerebral mitochondrial oxygen tension relate to the ability to generate a maximal voluntary contraction and to the transcranial magnetic stimulated force generation. To determine the role of a reduced OCI and in central fatigue, 16 males performed low intensity, maximal intensity and hypoxic cycling exercise. Exercise fatigue was evaluated by ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), arm maximal voluntary force (MVC), and voluntary activation of elbow flexor muscles assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation. Low intensity exercise did not produce any indication of central fatigue or marked cerebral metabolic deviations. Exercise in hypoxia (0.10) reduced cerebral oxygen delivery 25% and decreased 11+/-4 mmHg (P&lt;0.001) together with OCI (6.2+/-0.7 to 4.8+/-0.5, P&lt;0.001). RPE increased while MVC and voluntary activation were reduced (P&lt;0.05). During maximal exercise declined 8+/-4 mmHg (P&lt;0.05) and OCI to 3.8+/-0.5 (P&lt;0.001). RPE was 18.5, and MVC and voluntary activation were reduced (P&lt;0.05). We observed no signs of muscular fatigue in the elbow flexors and all control MVCs were similar to resting values. Exhaustive exercise provoked cerebral deoxygenation, metabolic changes and indices of fatigue similar to those observed during exercise in hypoxia indicating that reduced cerebral oxygenation may play a role in the development of central fatigue and may be an exercise capacity limiting factor.",

Skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue are considered to be the main sites of lactate production and release. Recent studies have demonstrated that there is a specific G-protein coupled receptor for lactate, GPR81, which is expressed primarily in adipose tissue, and also in muscle. Lactate inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue by mediating, through GPR81, the anti-lipolytic action of insulin. A high proportion (50\u00c2\u00a0% or more) of the glucose utilised by white adipose tissue is converted to lactate and lactate production by the tissue increases markedly in obesity; this is likely to reflect a switch towards anaerobic metabolism with the development of hypoxia in the tissue. During exercise, there is a shift in fuel utilisation by muscle from lipid to carbohydrate, but this does not appear to be a result of the inhibition of lipolysis in the main adipose tissue depots by muscle-derived lactate. It is suggested instead that a putative autocrine lactate loop in myocytes may regulate fuel utilisation by muscle during exercise, operating via a muscle GPR81 receptor. In addition to being an important substrate, lactate is a key signal in metabolic regulation.",

When 6mM L-lactate was perfused together with 100 mM glutamate there was a significant reduction in the size of the lesion and there was no reduction in dialysate glucose. When L-lactate was replaced with D-lactate the lesion size and the increase in dialysate lactate were greater than after glutamate alone.

    "abstxt": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) defects are an important cause of disease and may underlie aging and aging-related alterations (1,2). The mitochondrial theory of aging suggests a role for mtDNA mutations, which can alter bioenergetics homeostasis and cellular function, in the aging process (3). A wealth of evidence has been compiled in support of this theory (1,4), an example being the mtDNA mutator mouse (5); however, the precise role of mtDNA damage in aging is not entirely understood (6,7). Observing the activity of respiratory enzymes is a straightforward approach for investigating mitochondrial dysfunction. Complex IV, or cytochrome c oxidase (COX), is essential for mitochondrial function. The catalytic subunits of COX are encoded by mtDNA and are essential for assembly of the complex (Figure 1). Thus, proper synthesis and function are largely based on mtDNA integrity (2). Although other respiratory complexes could be investigated, Complexes IV and II are the most amenable to histochemical examination (8,9). Complex II, or succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), is entirely encoded by nuclear DNA (Figure 1), and its activity is typically not affected by impaired mtDNA, although an increase might indicate mitochondrial biogenesis (10-12). The impaired mtDNA observed in mitochondrial diseases, aging, and age-related diseases often leads to the presence of cells with low or absent COX activity (2,12-14). Although COX and SDH activities can be investigated individually, the sequential double-labeling method (15,16) has proved to be advantageous in locating cells with mitochondrial dysfunction (12,17-21). Many of the optimal constitutions of the assay have been determined, such as substrate concentration, electron acceptors/donors, intermediate electron carriers, influence of pH, and reaction time (9,22,23). 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) is an effective and reliable electron donor (22). In cells with functioning COX, the brown indamine polymer product will localize in mitochondrial cristae and saturate cells (22). Those cells with dysfunctional COX will therefore not be saturated by the DAB product, allowing for the visualization of SDH activity by reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), an electron acceptor, to a blue formazan end product (9,24). Cytochrome c and sodium succinate substrates are added to normalize endogenous levels between control and diseased/mutant tissues (9). Catalase is added as a precaution to avoid possible contaminating reactions from peroxidase activity (9,22). Phenazine methosulfate (PMS), an intermediate electron carrier, is used in conjunction with sodium azide, a respiratory chain inhibitor, to increase the formation of the final reaction products (9,25). Despite this information, some critical details affecting the result of this seemly straightforward assay, in addition to specificity controls and advances in the technique, have not yet been presented.",

In the present studies, image-guided 1H and 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to monitor the changes in lactate and high-energy phosphate concentrations produced by PS of visual cortex in six normal volunteers. PS initially produced a significant rise (to 250% of control, p less than 0.01) in visual cortex lactate during the first 6.4 min of PS, followed by a significant decline (p = 0.01) as PS continued. The PCr/Pi ratios decreased significantly from control values during the first 12.8 min of PS (p less than 0.05), and the pH was slightly increased. The positive P100 deflection of the visual evoked potential recorded between 100 and 172 ms after the strobe was significantly decreased from control at 12.8 min of PS (p less than 0.05). The finding that PS caused decreased PCr/Pi is consistent with the view that increased brain activity stimulated ATPase, causing a rise in ADP that shifted the creatine kinase reaction in the direction of ATP synthesis. The rise in lactate together with an increase in pH suggest that intracellular alkalosis, caused by the shift of creatine kinase, selectively stimulated glycolysis.",

Several studies published over the last 13 years challenged the assumption that the activated brain increases its oxidative glucose metabolism to meet the increased energy demands. Neuronal function in rat hippocampal slices supplied with 4 mM glucose could tolerate a 15 min activation by a 5 mM concentration of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (Glu), whereas slices supplied with 10 mM glucose could tolerate a 15 min activation by 20 mM Glu. However, in slices in which neuronal lactate use was inhibited by the lactate transporter inhibitor a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (4-CIN), activation by Glu elicited a permanent loss of neuronal function, with a twofold to threefold increase in tissue lactate content. Inhibition of glycolysis with the glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) during the period of exposure to Glu diminished normal neuronal function in the majority of slices and significantly reduced the number of slices that exhibited neuronal function after activation. However, when lactate was added with 2DG, the majority of the slices were neuronally functional after activation by Glu. NMDA, a nontransportable Glu analog by the glial glutamate transporter, could not induce a significant increase in slice lactate level when administered in the presence of 4-CIN. It is suggested that the heightened energy demands of activated neurons are met through increased glial glycolytic flux. The lactate thus formed is a crucial aerobic energy substrate that enables neurons to endure activation.",

At a concentration of 500 microM, 4-CIN blocked lactate-supported synaptic function in hippocampal slices under normoxic conditions in 15 min. The inhibitor had no effect on glucose-supported synaptic function. Of control hippocampal slices exposed to 10-min hypoxia, 77.8 +/- 6.8% recovered synaptic function after 30-min reoxygenation. Of slices supplemented with 500 microM 4-CIN, only 15 +/- 10.9% recovered synaptic function despite the large amount of lactate formed during the hypoxic period and the abundance of glucose present before, during, and after hypoxia. These results indicate that 4-CIN, when present during hypoxia and reoxygenation, blocks lactate transport from astrocytes, where the bulk of anaerobic lactate is formed, to neurons, where lactate is being utilized aerobically to support recovery of function after hypoxia. These results unequivocally validate that brain lactate is an obligatory aerobic energy substrate for posthypoxia recovery of function.",

To test the role of lactate as an aerobic energy substrate postischemia in vivo, we employed the cardiac-arrest-induced transient global cerebral ischemia (TGI) rat model and the monocarboxylate transporter inhibitor alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (4-CIN). Once 4-CIN was establish to cross the blood--brain barrier, rats were treated with the inhibitor 60 min prior to a 5-min TGI. These rats exhibited a significantly greater degree of delayed neuronal damage in the hippocampus than control, untreated rats, as measured 7 days post-TGI. We concluded that intra-ischemically-accumulated lactate is utilized aerobically as the main energy substrate immediately postischemia. Blockade of lactate transport into neurons prevents its utilization and, consequently, exacerbates delayed ischemic neuronal damage.",

The silencing of LDH-B in cancer cells occurs via DNA methylation, with involvement of the DNMTs (DNA methyltransferases) DNMT1 and DNMT3b. Colon cancer is also associated with the expression of pyruvate kinase M2, a splice variant with low catalytic activity. We have shown recently that pyruvate is an inhibitor of HDACs (histone deacetylases). Here we show that pyruvate is a specific inhibitor of HDAC1 and HDAC3. Lactate has no effect on any of the HDACs examined. Colon cancer cells exhibit increased HDAC activity compared with non-malignant cells. HDAC1 and HDAC3 are up-regulated in colon cancer cells and in primary colon cancer, and siRNA (small interfering RNA)-mediated silencing of HDAC1 and HDAC3 in colon cancer cells induces apoptosis. Colon cancer cells silence SLC5A8, the gene coding for a Na(+)-coupled pyruvate transporter. Heterologous expression of SLC5A8 in the human colon cancer cell line SW480 leads to inhibition of HDAC activity when cultured in the presence of pyruvate. This process is associated with an increase in intracellular levels of pyruvate, increase in the acetylation status of histone H4, and enhanced cell death. These studies show that cancer cells effectively maintain low levels of pyruvate to prevent inhibition of HDAC1/HDAC3 and thereby to evade cell death.",

We will review evidence from microdialysis studies for a relationship between neurotransmitters and lactate production, as revealed in studies of the effects of psychotropic drugs on stress-induced enhancement of extracellular lactate concentrations. Glutamate enhances stress-induced lactate production via activation of N-methyl-D-asparate receptors, and is affected by uptake of glutamate through glutamate transporters. Findings from microdialysis studies suggest that major neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and GABA (via benzodiazepine-receptors) affect lactate production, depending on brain areas, especially during stress. Among these neurotransmitters, glutamate may principally contribute to the regulation of lactate production, with other neurotransmitter systems affecting the extracellular lactate levels in a glutamate-mediated manner. The role for anaerobic metabolism in the supply of energy, as represented by lactate dynamics, deserves further clarification. Monitoring with intracerebral microdialysis is a reliable method for this purpose. Research into this area is likely to provide a novel insight into the mode of action of psychotropic drugs, and the pathophysiology of some of the stress-related mental disorders as well.",

    "abstxt": "Besides the dopaminergic (DA-ergic) neurons possessing the whole set of enzymes of DA synthesis from l-tyrosine and the DA membrane transporter (DAT), the neurons partly expressing the DA-ergic phenotype have been first discovered two decades ago. Most of the neurons express individual enzymes of DA synthesis, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and lack the DAT. A list of the neurons partly expressing the DA-ergic phenotype is not restricted to so-called monoenzymatic neurons, e.g. it includes some neurons co-expressing both enzymes of DA synthesis but lacking the DAT. In contrast to true DA-ergic neurons, monoenzymatic neurons and bienzymatic non-dopaminergic neurons lack the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) that raises a question about the mechanisms of storing and release of their final synthetic products. Monoenzymatic neurons are widely distributed all through the brain in adulthood being in some brain regions even more numerous than DA-ergic neurons. Individual enzymes of DA synthesis are expressed in these neurons continuously or transiently in norm or under certain physiological conditions. Monoenzymatic neurons, particularly those expressing TH, appear to be even more numerous and more widely distributed in the brain during ontogenesis than in adulthood. Most populations of monoenzymatic TH neurons decrease in number or even disappear by puberty. Functional significance of monoenzymatic neurons remained uncertain for a long time after their discovery. Nevertheless, it has been shown that most monoenzymatic TH neurons and AADC neurons are capable to produce l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) from l-tyrosine and DA from L-DOPA, respectively. L-DOPA produced in monoenzymatic TH neurons is assumed to play a role of a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator acting on target neurons via catecholamine receptors. Moreover, according to our hypothesis L-DOPA released from monoenzymatic TH neurons is captured by monoenzymatic AADC neurons for DA synthesis. Such cooperative synthesis of DA is considered as a compensatory reaction under a failure of DA-ergic neurons, e.g. in neurodegenerative diseases like hyperprolactinemia and Parkinson's disease.Thus, a substantial number of the brain neurons express partly the DA-ergic phenotype, mostly individual complementary enzymes of DA synthesis, serving to produce DA in cooperation that is supposed to be a compensatory reaction under the failure of DA-ergic neurons.",

Aerobic glycolysis is present in the normal human brain at rest and increases locally during increased neuronal activity; yet its many biological functions have received scant attention because of a prevailing energy-centric focus on the role of glucose as substrate for oxidative phosphorylation. As an initial step in redressing this neglect, we measured the regional distribution of aerobic glycolysis with positron emission tomography in 33 neurologically normal young adults at rest. We show that the distribution of aerobic glycolysis in the brain is differentially present in previously well-described functional areas. In particular, aerobic glycolysis is significantly elevated in medial and lateral parietal and prefrontal cortices. In contrast, the cerebellum and medial temporal lobes have levels of aerobic glycolysis significantly below the brain mean. The levels of aerobic glycolysis are not strictly related to the levels of brain energy metabolism. For example, sensory cortices exhibit high metabolic rates for glucose and oxygen consumption but low rates of aerobic glycolysis. These striking regional variations in aerobic glycolysis in the normal human brain provide an opportunity to explore how brain systems differentially use the diverse cell biology of glucose in support of their functional specializations in health and disease.",

Later it was recognized that skeletal muscle not only played an important role in lactate production but also in lactate clearance and this led to a renewed interest, not the least from the Copenhagen School in the 1930s, in the metabolic role of lactate in skeletal muscle. With the introduction of lactate isotopes muscle lactate kinetics and oxidation could be studied and a simultaneous lactate uptake and release was observed, not only in muscle but also in other tissues. Therefore, this review will discuss in vivo human: (1) skeletal muscle lactate metabolism at rest and during exercise and suggestions are put forward to explain the simultaneous lactate uptake and release; and (2) lactate metabolism in the heart, liver, kidneys, brain, adipose tissue and lungs will be discussed and its potential importance in these tissues.",

However, the Glc-6-P produced can then enter one or more of several alternative pathways. Selective expression of isozymic forms of hexokinase, differing in catalytic and regulatory properties as well as subcellular localization, is likely to be an important factor in determining the pattern of Glc metabolism in mammalian tissues/cells. Despite their overall structural similarity, the Type I, Type II and Type III isozymes differ in important respects. All three isozymes are inhibited by the product, Glc-6-P, but with the Type I isozyme, this inhibition is antagonized by P(I), whereas with the Type II and Type III isozymes, P(i) actually causes additional inhibition. Reciprocal changes in intracellular levels of Glc-6-P and P(i) are closely associated with cellular energy status, and it is proposed that the response of the Type I isozyme to these effectors adapts it for catabolic function, introducing Glc into glycolytic metabolism for energy production. In contrast, the Type II, and probably the Type III, isozymes are suggested to serve primarily anabolic functions, e.g. to provide Glc-6-P for glycogen synthesis or metabolism via the pentose phosphate pathway for lipid synthesis. Type I hexokinase binds to mitochondria through interaction with porin, the protein that forms channels through which metabolites traverse the outer mitochondrial membrane. Several experimental approaches have led to the conclusion that the Type I isozyme, bound to actively phosphorylating mitochondria, selectively uses intramitochondrial ATP as substrate. Such interactions are thought to facilitate coordination of the introduction of Glc into glycolysis, via the hexokinase reaction, with the terminal oxidative stages of Glc metabolism occurring in the mitochondria, thus ensuring an overall rate of Glc metabolism commensurate with cellular energy demands and avoiding excessive production of lactate. The Type II isozyme also binds to mitochondria. Whether such coupling occurs with mitochondrially bound Type II hexokinase in normal tissues, and how it might be related to the proposed anabolic role of this isozyme, remain to be determined. The Type III isozyme lacks the hydrophobic N-terminal sequence known to be critical for binding of the Type I and Type II isozymes to mitochondria. Immunolocalization studies have indicated that, in many cell types, the Type III has a perinuclear localization, the possible metabolic consequences of which remain unclear.",

    "abstxt": "Cerebral energy metabolism is a highly compartmentalized and complex process in which transcellular trafficking of metabolites plays a pivotal role. Over the past decade, a role for lactate in fueling the energetic requirements of neurons has emerged. Furthermore, a neuroprotective effect of lactate during hypoglycemia or cerebral ischemia has been reported. The majority of the current evidence concerning lactate metabolism at the cellular level is based on in vitro data; only a few recent in vivo results have demonstrated that the brain preferentially utilizes lactate over glucose. Using voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging, beta-probe measurements of radiotracer kinetics, and brain activation by sensory stimulation in the anesthetized rat, we investigated several aspects of cerebral lactate metabolism. The present study is the first in vivo demonstration of the maintenance of neuronal activity in the presence of lactate as the primary energy source. The loss of the voltage-sensitive dye signal found during severe insulin-induced hypoglycemia is completely prevented by lactate infusion. Thus, lactate has a direct neuroprotective effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the brain readily oxidizes lactate in an activity-dependent manner. The washout of 1-[(11)C]L-lactate, reflecting cerebral lactate oxidation, was observed to increase during brain activation from 0.077 \u00b1 0.009 to 0.105 \u00b1 0.007 min(-1). Finally, our data confirm that the brain prefers lactate over glucose as an energy substrate when both substrates are available. Using [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to measure the local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose, we demonstrated a lactate concentration-dependent reduction of cerebral glucose utilization during experimentally increased plasma lactate levels.",

    "abstxt": "The mitochondrial transporter, the aspartate/glutamate carrier (AGC), is a necessary component of the malate/aspartate cycle, which promotes the transfer into mitochondria of reducing equivalents generated in the cytosol during glycolysis. Without transfer of cytosolic reducing equivalents into mitochondria, neither glucose nor lactate can be completely oxidized. In the present study, immunohistochemistry was used to demonstrate the absence of AGC from retinal glia (M\u7aefller cells), but its presence in neurons and photoreceptor cells. To determine the influence of the absence of AGC on sources of ATP for glutamate neurotransmission, neurotransmission was estimated in both light- and dark-adapted retinas by measuring flux through the glutamate/glutamine cycle and the effect of light on ATP-generating reactions. Neurotransmission was 80% faster in the dark as expected, because photoreceptors become depolarized in the dark and this depolarization induces release of excitatory glutamate neurotransmitter. Oxidation of [U-14C]glucose, [1-14C]lactate, and [1-14C]pyruvate in light- and dark-adapted excised retinas was estimated by collecting 14CO2. Neither glucose nor lactate oxidation that require participation of the malate/aspartate shuttle increased in the dark, but pyruvate oxidation that does not require the malate/aspartate shuttle increased to 36% in the dark. Aerobic glycolysis was estimated by measuring the rate of lactate appearance. Glycolysis was 37% faster in the dark. It appears that in the retina, ATP consumed during glutamatergic neurotransmission is replenished by ATP generated glycolytically within the retinal M\u7aefller cells and that oxidation of glucose within the M\u7aefller cells does not occur or occurs only slowly.",
