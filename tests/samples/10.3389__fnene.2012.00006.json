    "abstxt": "Local and superficial near-infrared (NIR) optical-property characterization of turbid biological tissues can be achieved by measurement of spatially resolved diffuse reflectance at small source-detector separations (&lt;1.4 mm). However, in these conditions the inverse problem, i.e., calculation of localized absorption and the reduced scattering coefficients, is necessarily sensitive to the scattering phase function. This effect can be minimized if a new parameter of the phase function gamma, which depends on the first and the second moments of the phase function, is known. If gamma is unknown, an estimation of this parameter can be obtained by the measurement, but the uncertainty of the absorption coefficient is increased. A spatially resolved reflectance probe employing multiple detector fibers (0.3-1.4 mm from the source) is described. Monte Carlo simulations are used to determine gamma, the reduced scattering and absorption coefficients from reflectance data. Probe performance is assessed by measurements on phantoms, the optical properties of which were measured by other techniques [frequency domain photon migration (FDPM) and spatially resolved transmittance]. Our results show that changes in the absorption coefficient, the reduced scattering coefficient, and gamma can be measured to within +/-0.005 mm(-1), +/-0.05 mm(-1), and +/-0.2, respectively. In vivo measurements performed intraoperatively on a human skull and brain are reported for four NIR wavelengths (674, 811, 849, 956 nm) when the spatially resolved probe and FDPM are used. The spatially resolved probe shows optimum measurement sensitivity in the measurement volume immediately beneath the probe (typically 1 mm(3) in tissues), whereas FDPM typically samples larger regions of tissues. Optical-property values for human skull, white matter, scar tissue, optic nerve, and tumors are reported that show distinct absorption and scattering differences between structures and a dependence on the phase-function parameter gamma.",

    "abstxt": "Diffuse optical imaging can measure brain activity noninvasively in humans through the scalp and skull by measuring the light intensity modulation arising from localized-activity-induced absorption changes within the cortex. Spatial resolution and localization accuracy are currently limited by measurement geometry to approximately 3 cm in the plane parallel to the scalp. Depth resolution is a more significant challenge owing to the limited angle tomography permitted by reflectance-only measurements. We combine previously established concepts for improving image quality and demonstrate, through simulation studies, their application for improving the image quality of adult human brain function. We show in a three-dimensional human head model that localization accuracy is significantly improved by the addition of measurements that provide overlapping samples of brain tissue. However, the reconstructed absorption contrast is significantly underestimated because its depth is underestimated. We show that the absorption contrast amplitude accuracy can be significantly improved by providing a cortical spatial constraint in the image reconstruction to obtain a better depth localization. The cortical constraint makes physiological sense since the brain-activity-induced absorption changes are occurring in the cortex and not in the scalp, skull, and cerebral spinal fluid. This spatial constraint is provided by segmentation of coregistered structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the absorption contrast deep within the cortex is reconstructed superficially, resulting in an underestimation of the absorption contrast. The synthesis of techniques described here indicates that multimodality imaging of brain function with diffuse optical imaging and MRI has the potential to provide more quantitative estimates of the total and deoxyhemoglobin response to brain activation, which is currently not provided by either method independently. However, issues of depth resolution within the cortex remain to be resolved.",

An NIR image reconstruction that exploits the combined data set is presented that implements the MR structure as a soft-constraint in the NIR property estimation. The algorithm incorporates the MR spatially segmented regions into a regularization matrix that links locations with similar MR properties, and applies a Laplacian-type filter to minimize variation within each region. When prior knowledge of the structure of phantoms is used to guide NIR property estimation, root mean square (rms) image error decreases from 26 to 58%. For a representative in vivo case, images of hemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, water fraction, scattering power, and scattering amplitude are derived and the properties of adipose and fibroglandular breast tissue types, identified from MRI, are quantified. Fibroglandular tissue is observed to have more than four times as much water content as adipose tissue, almost twice as much blood volume, and slightly reduced oxygen saturation. This approach is expected to improve recovery of abnormalities within the breast, as the inclusion of structural information increases the accuracy of recovery of embedded heterogeneities, at least in phantom studies.",

The diffusion approximation to photon transport is much faster to simulate than the physically correct radiative transport equation (RTE); however, it is commonly assumed that scattering lengths must be much smaller than all system dimensions and all absorption lengths for the approximation to be accurate. Neither of these conditions is satisfied in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Since line-of-sight distances in the CSF are small, of the order of a few millimeters, we explore the idea that the CSF scattering coefficient may be modeled by any value from zero up to the order of the typical inverse line-of-sight distance, or approximately 0.3 mm(-1), without significantly altering the calculated detector signals or the partial path lengths relevant for functional measurements. We demonstrate this in detail by using a Monte Carlo simulation of the RTE in a three-dimensional head model based on clinical magnetic resonance imaging data, with realistic optode geometries. Our findings lead us to expect that the diffusion approximation will be valid even in the presence of the CSF, with consequences for faster solution of the inverse problem.",

The mean distance between the peak response in the image and the estimated position of the contralateral motor cortex was 10.8 mm. These results suggest that optical tomography may provide an appropriate technique for non-invasive cot-side imaging of brain function.",

The spatial sensitivity profile turns out to seem like a fat tropical fish with strong distortion along the folding cerebral surface. The sensitive brain region covers the gray matter and extends to the superficial white matter, leading to a large penetration depth (&gt;3 cm). Finally, the optimal source-detector separation is suggested to be narrowed down to 3-3.5 cm, while the sensitivity of the detected signal to brain activation reaches the peak of 8%.

We apply two different diffuse optical tomographic (DOT) systems (i.e., DYNOT and CW5), with various probe arrangements to evaluate RSFC in the sensorimotor cortex by utilizing a previously published experimental protocol and seed-based correlation analysis. Our results exhibit similar spatial patterns and strengths in RSFC between the bilateral motor cortexes. The consistent observations are obtained from both DYNOT and CW5 systems, and are also in good agreement with the previous fNIRS study.

From the neuron cultured to the exposed cortex in the human during neurosurgical procedures, high spatial resolution can be reached and several processes such as membrane potential, cell swelling, metabolism of mitochondrial chromophores, and vascular response can be monitored, depending on the respective preparation. The authors focus on an extension of optical methods to the noninvasive application in the human. Starting with the pioneering work of J\u00f6bsis 25 years ago, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used to investigate functional activation of the human cerebral cortex. Recently, several groups have started to use imaging systems that allow the generation of images of a larger area of the subject's head and, thereby, the production of maps of cortical oxygenation changes. Such images have a much lower spatial resolution compared with the invasively obtained optical images. The noninvasive NIRS images, however, can be obtained in undemanding set-ups that can be easily combined with other functional methods, in particular EEG. Moreover, NIRS is applicable to bedside use. The authors briefly review some of the abundant literature on intrinsic optical signals and the NIRS imaging studies of the past few years. The weaknesses and strengths of the approach are critically discussed. The authors conclude that NIRS imaging has two major advantages: it can address issues concerning neurovascular coupling in the human adult and can extend functional imaging approaches to the investigation of the diseased brain.",

Standard resolution testing is optimal when infinite contrast is used and hardware evaluation is the goal. However, deep tissue imaging of absorption or fluorescent contrast agents in vivo often presents a different problem, which requires contrast-detail analysis. This analysis shows that the minimum detectable sizes are in the range of 1/10 the outer diameter, whereas minimum detectable contrast values are in the range of 10 to 20% relative to the continuous background values. This is estimated for objects being in the center of the domain being imaged, and as the heterogeneous region becomes closer to the surface, the lower limit on size and contrast can become arbitrarily low and more dictated by hardware specifications. Finally, if human observer detection of abnormalities in the images is the goal, as is standard in most radiological practice, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and location receiver operating characteristic curve (LROC) are used. Each of these three major areas of image interpretation and analysis are reviewed in the context of medical imaging as well as how they are used to quantify the performance of diffuse optical imaging of tissue.",

Here, we describe four separate sources for systematic error in the calculation of focal hemoglobin changes from NIRS data and use experimental methods and Monte Carlo simulations to examine the importance and mitigation methods of each. The sources of error are: (1). the absolute magnitudes and relative differences in pathlength factors as a function of wavelength, (2). the location and spatial extent of the absorption change with respect to the optical probe, (3). possible differences in the spatial distribution of hemoglobin species, and (4). the potential for simultaneous monitoring of multiple regions of activation. We found wavelength selection and optode placement to be important variables in minimizing such errors, and our findings indicate that appropriate experimental procedures could reduce each of these errors to a small fraction (&lt;10%) of the observed concentration changes.",

Previous optical studies have evaluated the temporal features of spontaneous resting brain signals. Herein, we develop techniques for spatially mapping functional connectivity with DOT (fc-DOT). Simultaneous imaging over the motor and visual cortices yielded robust correlation maps reproducing the expected functional neural architecture. The localization of the maps was confirmed with task-response studies and with subject-matched fc-MRI. These fc-DOT methods provide a task-less approach to mapping brain function in populations that were previously difficult to research. Our advances may permit new studies of early childhood development and of unconscious patients. In addition, the comprehensive hemoglobin contrasts of fc-DOT enable innovative studies of the biophysical origin of the functional connectivity signal.",

We show herein the utility of the DOT system by presenting functional hemodynamic maps of the adult human visual cortex. The functional brain images have a high contrast-to-noise ratio, allowing visualization of individual activations and highly repeatable mapping within and across subjects. With the improved spatial resolution and localization, we were able to image functional responses of 1.7 cm in extent and shifts of &lt;1 cm.
