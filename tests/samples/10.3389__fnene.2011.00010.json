Destruction of damaged retina by photocoagulation remains the primary treatment nearly 50 years after its introduction. The diabetes pandemic requires new approaches to understand the pathophysiology and improve the detection, prevention, and treatment of retinopathy. This perspective considers how the unique anatomy and physiology of the retina may predispose it to the metabolic stresses of diabetes. The roles of neural retinal alterations and impaired retinal insulin action in the pathogenesis of early retinopathy and the mechanisms of vision loss are emphasized. Potential means to overcome limitations of current animal models and diagnostic testing are also presented with the goal of accelerating therapies to manage retinopathy in the face of ongoing diabetes.",

Inasmuch as aminoguanidine is a relatively selective inhibitor of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), we have investigated the effects of hyperglycemia on the retinal nitric oxide (NO) pathway in the presence and absence of aminoguanidine. In vivo studies utilized retinas from experimentally diabetic rats treated or without aminoguanidine for 2 months, and in vitro studies used bovine retinal endothelial cells and a transformed retinal glial cell line (rMC-1) incubated in 5 mm and 25 mm glucose with and without aminoguanidine (100 microg/mL). NO was detected as nitrite and nitrate, and nitrotyrosine and iNOS were detected using immunochemical methods. Retinal homogenates from diabetic animals had greater than normal levels of NO and iNOS (p &lt; 0.05), and nitrotyrosine was greater than normal, especially in one band immunoprecipitated from retinal homogenates. Oral aminoguanidine significantly inhibited all of these increases. Nitrotyrosine was detected immunohistochemically only in the retinal vasculature of non-diabetic and diabetic animals. Retinal endothelial and rMC-1 cells cultured in high glucose increased NO and NT, and aminoguanidine inhibited both increases in rMC-1 cells, but only NT in endothelial cells. Hyperglycemia increases NO production in retinal cells, and aminoguanidine can inhibit this abnormality. Inhibition of diabetic retinopathy by aminoguanidine might be mediated in part by inhibition of sequelae of NO production.",

    "abstxt": "Diabetes is known to cause significant alterations in the retinal vasculature. Indeed, diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in those of working age. Considerable evidence is emerging that indicates that retinal neurons are also altered during diabetes. Moreover, many types of neuronal deficits have been observed in animal models and patients prior to the onset of vascular compromise. Such clinical tools as the flash ERG, multifocal ERG, colour vision, contrast sensitivity and short-wavelength automated perimetry, all provide novel means whereby neuronal dysfunction can be detected at early stages of diabetes. The underlying mechanisms that lead to neuronal deficits are likely to be broad. Retinal glial cells play an essential role in maintaining the normal function of the retina. There is accumulating evidence that M\u7aefller cells are abnormal during diabetes. They are known to become gliotic, display altered potassium siphoning, glutamate and GABA uptake and are also known to express several modulators of angiogenesis. This review will examine the evidence that neurons and glia are altered during diabetes and the relationship these changes have with vascular compromise.",

Aminoguanidine treatment completely prevented abnormal endothelial cell proliferation and significantly diminished pericyte dropout. After 75 weeks, untreated diabetic animals developed an 18.6-fold increase in the number of acellular capillaries and formed capillary microaneurysms, characteristic pathologic features of background diabetic retinopathy. In contrast, aminoguanidine-treated diabetic animals had only a 3.6-fold increase in acellular capillaries and no microaneurysms.

Either agent was administered daily in doses of 20-25 mg. kg(-1). day(-1). Because severity of hyperglycemia greatly influences development of the retinopathy, special effort was devoted to maintaining comparable glycemia in experimental and control groups. The retinal vasculature was isolated by the trypsin digest method, and retinopathy was assessed by light microscopy. Diabetes for 5 years resulted, as expected, in saccular capillary aneurysms, pericyte ghosts, acellular capillaries, retinal hemorrhages, and other lesions. Administration of aminoguanidine essentially prevented the retinopathy, significantly inhibiting the development of retinal microaneurysms, acellular capillaries, and pericyte ghosts compared with diabetic controls. Aspirin significantly inhibited the development of retinal hemorrhages and acellular capillaries over the 5 years of study, but had less effect on other lesions. Although diabetes resulted in significantly increased levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) (namely, pentosidine in tail collagen and aorta, and Hb-AGE), aminoguanidine had no significant influence on these parameters of glycation. Nitration of a retinal protein was significantly increased in diabetes and inhibited by aminoguanidine. The biochemical mechanism by which aminoguanidine has inhibited retinopathy thus is not clear. Aminoguanidine (but not aspirin) inhibited a diabetes-induced defect in ulnar nerve conduction velocity, but neither agent was found to influence kidney structure or albumen excretion.",

We found that light stimulation and glial cell stimulation can both evoke dilation or constriction of arterioles. Light-evoked and glial-evoked vasodilations were blocked by inhibitors of cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, the synthetic enzyme for epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Vasoconstrictions, in contrast, were blocked by an inhibitor of omega-hydroxylase, which synthesizes 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Nitric oxide influenced whether vasodilations or vasoconstrictions were produced in response to light and glial stimulation. Light-evoked vasoactivity was blocked when neuron-to-glia signaling was interrupted by a purinergic antagonist. These results indicate that glial cells contribute to neurovascular coupling and suggest that regulation of blood flow may involve both vasodilating and vasoconstricting components.",

This response, termed functional hyperemia, is diminished in the retinas of diabetic patients, possibly contributing to the development of diabetic retinopathy. The mechanism responsible for this loss is unknown. Here we show that light-evoked arteriole dilation was reduced by 58% in a streptozotocin-induced rat model of type 1 diabetes. Functional hyperemia is believed to be mediated by glial cells and we found that glial-evoked vasodilation was reduced by 60% in diabetic animals. The diabetic retinas showed neither a decrease in the thickness of the retinal layers nor an increase in neuronal loss, although signs of early glial reactivity and an upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were detected. Inhibition of iNOS restored both light- and glial-evoked dilations to control levels. These findings suggest that high NO levels resulting from iNOS upregulation alters glial control of vessel diameter and may underlie the loss of functional hyperemia observed in diabetic retinopathy. Restoring functional hyperemia by iNOS inhibition may limit the progression of retinopathy in diabetic patients.",

Trypsin digests and sections prepared from the retinas of seven patients (age 67 +/- 7 yr) with .9 +/- 4 yr of diabetes and eight age- and sex-matched nondiabetic controls were studied with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) reaction which detects preferentially apoptotic DNA fragmentation. The count of total TUNEL+ nuclei was significantly greater in the microvessels of diabetic (13 +/- 12 per one-sixth of retina) than control subjects (1.3 +/- 1.4, P = 0.0016), as were the counts of TUNEL+ pericytes and endothelial cells (P &lt; 0.006). The neural retinas from both diabetic and nondiabetic subjects were uniformly TUNEL-. Retinal microvessels of rats with short duration of experimental diabetes or galactosemia and absent or minimal morphological changes of retinopathy, showed TUNEL+ pericytes and endothelial cells, which were absent in control rats. These findings indicate that (a) diabetes and galactosemia lead to accelerated death in situ of both retinal pericytes and endothelial cells; (b) the event is specific for vascular cells; (c) it precedes histological evidence of retinopathy; and (d) it can be induced by isolated hyperhexosemia. A cycle of accelerated death and renewal of endothelial cells may contribute to vascular architectural changes and, upon exhaustion of replicative life span, to capillary obliteration.",

Figure 5 shows some sets of action spectra from a single unit. For each curve the criterion of action was hyperpolarization to a fixed level, by lights of various wave-lengths. When these lights fell upon zero background (circles) the curves show that two kinds of cone contribute to the action spectrum, one with the 620 nm pigment of Marks and one with the 680 nm pigment of Naka &amp; Rushton (1966a).3. When the lights fell upon (i) a fixed green background (triangles, Fig. 5), or (ii) a fixed red one (squares), the action spectra changed in a way that indicated greater prominence of (i) the 680 nm system (ii) the 540 nm green system that was not conspicuous without adaptation to red.4. These observations (on the tench Tinca) are contrary to the conclusions of Svaetichin &amp; McNichol (on Gerridae) that the action spectrum is unaltered in shape by adaptation to coloured lights. The contribution of the green cones, for example, was actually absolutely greater under deep red adaptation.5. It is concluded that L-units receive signals from 680, 620, 540 nm and possibly also the blue cones, that the quantum catch in all these contribute to the hyperpolarization produced, but their interaction is more complicated than the simple addition of independent cone effects.",

These post-translational modifications have the potential to disrupt the structural and functional properties of the lens crystallins and contribute to the formation of cataracts. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were used to study the relationship between glycation of lens proteins and the formation of insoluble high-molecular-weight (HMW) aggregates believed to be responsible for cataract formation. After the onset of diabetes, cataracts developed in about 12- to 13 weeks. The animals were followed in this manner until cataracts developed and for an additional 63 days. Five control and five diabetic rats were killed every 3 weeks and lenses removed. Levels of glycated protein and glycated amino acids in lenses from each animal were examined by affinity chromatography. In addition, the changes in crystallin composition and development of HMW aggregates were monitored by molecular-sieve HPLC techniques. As diabetic hyperglycemia continued there was a linear increase in glycated protein in both the soluble and insoluble fractions. This increase was paralleled by an increase in the soluble HMW and insoluble HMW aggregates. Other changes included a decrease in reactive sulfhydryls which indicates an increase in disulfide bond formation. The gamma-crystallin levels also decreased in a linear fashion during the hyperglycemic pre-cataract and cataract stages. It appears that the glycation of lens crystallin, the disappearance of reactive sulfhydryls and the formation of HMW aggregates are interrelated.",

They represent, therefore, highly valuable tissues for studies of the intrinsic physiological mechanism postulated more than 100 years ago by Roy and Sherrington, by which neural activity is coupled to blood flow and metabolism. This article describes a series of animal and human studies that explored the changes in hemodynamics and oxygenation in the retina and optic nerve in response to increased neural activity, as well as the mechanisms underlying these changes. It starts with a brief review of techniques used to assess changes in neural activity, hemodynamics, metabolism and tissue concentration of various potential mediators and modulators of the coupling. We then review: (a) the characteristics of the flicker-induced hemodynamical response in different regions of the eye, starting with the optic nerve, the region predominantly studied; (b) the effect of varying the stimulus parameters, such as modulation depth, frequency, luminance, color ratio, area of stimulation, site of measurement and others, on this response; (c) data on activity-induced intrinsic reflectance and functional magnetic resonance imaging signals from the optic nerve and retina. The data undeniably demonstrate that visual stimulation is a powerful modulator of retinal and optic nerve blood flow. Exploring the relationship between vasoactivity and metabolic changes on one side and corresponding neural activity changes on the other confirms the existence of a neurovascular/neurometabolic coupling in the neural tissue of the eye fundus and reveals that the mechanism underlying this coupling is complex and multi-factorial. The importance of fully exploiting the potential of the activity-induced vascular changes in the assessment of the pathophysiology of ocular diseases motivated studies aimed at identifying potential mediators and modulators of the functional hyperemia, as well as conditions susceptible to alter this physiological response. Altered hemodynamical responses to flicker were indeed observed during a number of physiological and pharmacological interventions and in a number of clinical conditions, such as essential systemic hypertension, diabetes, ocular hypertension and early open-angle glaucoma. The article concludes with a discussion of key questions that remain to be elucidated to increase our understanding of the physiology of ocular functional hyperemia and establish the importance of assessing the neurovascular coupling in the diagnosis and management of optic nerve and retinal diseases.",
