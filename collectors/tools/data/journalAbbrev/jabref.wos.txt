# Jabref abbreviations from ISI Web of Science
# Alistair Auffret 
# 17 November 2011 
# This was created using R (the only programming language i know), extracting the abbreviations from the web of science lists. 
# It is not perfect, as there are issues with capitalisation in acronyms, and when journal names use commas, 
# but it was quite a fast way of getting most of the nearly 60000 journal titles and abbreviations into jab ref.
# Assuming the URL for the abbreviation lists stays the same, you can use the following code in R to create an updated list
#
#
#mixednames<-vector() #create empty vector
#
#for(i in LETTERS){ #for A-Z
#j<-paste("http://images.webofknowledge.com/WOK46/help/WOS/",i,"_abrvjt.html",sep="") # take the whole web page
#k<-read.csv(j)
#mixednames<-c(mixednames,as.character(k[,1]))
#}
# 
#wos.abb<-mixednames[grep(">\t",mixednames)] #get the abbreviations, identified by the html table code
#wos.abb<-substr(wos.abb,regexpr(">\t",wos.abb)[2]+2,nchar(as.character(wos.abb))) # remove that code
#
#wos.full<-mixednames[grep("<DT>",mixednames)] #get the full names, identified by the html table code
#wos.full<-substr(wos.full,regexpr("<DT>",wos.full)[2]+4,nchar(as.character(wos.full))) # remove that code
#wos.full[1]<-"A + U-ARCHITECTURE AND URBANISM" # remove the hanging code on the first entry
#
## simple function to capitalise first letter of each word (from ?toupper)
#
#     capwords <- function(s, strict = FALSE) {
#         cap <- function(s) paste(toupper(substring(s,1,1)),
#                       {s <- substring(s,2); if(strict) tolower(s) else s},
#                                  sep = "", collapse = " " )
#         sapply(strsplit(s, split = " "), cap, USE.NAMES = !is.null(names(s)))
#     }
#
#jabref.wos<-paste(capwords(tolower(wos.full)),"=",capwords(tolower(wos.abb))) # paste the full names and the abbreviations in jabref #format, changing the capitalisation
#jabref.wos<-gsub("&amp;","&",jabref.wos) # replace the html & for a real &
#jabref.wos<-gsub(" In "," in ",jabref.wos) # replace some words which shouldn't be capitalised
#jabref.wos<-gsub(" For "," for ",jabref.wos) 
#jabref.wos<-gsub(" And "," and ",jabref.wos) 
#jabref.wos<-gsub(" To "," to ",jabref.wos) 
#write.csv(jabref.wos,"jabref.wos.txt",row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE) # save it
